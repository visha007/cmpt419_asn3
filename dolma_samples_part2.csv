"Dr. John E. Sarno's Healing Back Pain is a New York Times bestseller that has helped over 500,000 readers. Continuing the research since his groundbreaking book, the renowned physician now presents his most complete work yet on the vital connection between mental and bodily health, The Mindbody Prescription.
Musculoskeletal pain disorders have reached epidemic proportions in the United States, with most doctors failing to recognize their underlying cause. In this acclaimed volume, Dr. Sarno reveals how many painful conditions--including most neck and back pain, migraine, repetitive stress injuries, whiplash, and tendonitises--are rooted in repressed emotions . . . and shows how they can be successfully treated without drugs, physical measures, or surgery. His innovative program has already produced gratifying results for thousands of patients. The Mindbody Prescription is your invaluable key to a healthy and pain-free life.
Mindbody Connection for Healing is Interesting Idea.
I've read the other reviews for this book. Some are lengthy, erudite discussions of the fine points of Sarno's theories.
I think everyone who has really thought about it seriously, realizes that of course our minds can control our bodies to an extent. Sarno's basic thinking is that most diseases, chronic pain, etc. can be grouped together in one neat package, and by using his process, cures and relief can be affected.
In many cases, I think this is true. My only problem with the premise of the book is that if you accept his ideas and use his process, but do not experience a diminishing of pain, or a cure for a chronic condition, it's your fault for not doing it well enough, long enough, or correctly. This may not be his intent, but it's what I came away with after having read the book carefully, twice, highlighting important points.
I find it problematic that if a patient tries very hard, follows all the steps outlined, and still suffers, he/she will exacerbate the chronic condition or chronic pain because of guilt and feelings of failure.
This is one person's opinion. Take it for what it's worth. I will continue to meditate, use biofeedback, and rest in a dark room when I get a debilitating migraine. And, yes, I will medicate according to my pain doctor's directions, too.
If you suffer from chronic pain, this is a must read.
This doctor really knows how to fix chronic pain. I went to see one of his collegues about terrible chronic muscle problems due to overuse and fibromyalgia that had spread to all parts of my body. I had been dealing with this for 3+ years; even the Mayo Clinic told me that there was nothing they could do.
It seemed like a miracle when my pain cleared up and I got my life back. Most of the pain went away in 3-4 months. I still deal with it from time to time but I have the tools to deal with it now.
This approach isn't easy, but with persistence it absolutely works.
I still apply Dr. John Sarno's methods today, and am now very much in control of my disorder, thanks to his help.
This book described the cause of my pain and muscle dysfunction. No doctors that I visited could figure it out. But Sarno has identified a very specific syndrome that many people have, and it is not theoretical...he has done a very good job of documenting his success with a specific theraputic process. It's both easy and hard to do...it's hard to grasp the fact that a brain process could cause so much pain and muscle spasm, easy because once you follow the therapy, you realize how simple it is to reverse the process.
Here's how it was for me:I was at the end of my rope. I had been to orthopedic surgeons, rehab doctors, chiropractors, accupuncturists and many physical therapists. I had constant pain with intermittent bouts of severe back spasms. After a couple of years I had to quit work because I was in so much pain. I spent most of the day lying down. Oh, and I was on three kinds of medicine. This was about 4 years into this problem that never seemed to get better, yet no doctor could find a real cause (except things like disc compression).
I ran into Sarno's prior book, Healing Back Pain. Within about 3 days of reading the book, my pain started to subside. In 3 weeks the pain was about 50% and in 2 months it was gone. The book describes a series of steps you need to take to get rid of the pain and muscle spasms. It is basically a cognative therapy process in which you focus on specific stresses.
It was scary to get back into activities after being fearful of lifting, sitting, twisting, bending, etc. Now I ski, play basketball, golf, tennis, and have zero pain. Sarno describes how he came about his theraputic process. It sounds like black magic. But I am an engineer that believes in science, and Sarno did his homework. I want other people to get rid of their pain, too.
Of course not all back pain fits this model, but it seems like much of mid-life back pain could be caused by this specific syndrome. Sarno describes particular personality types that are apt to have this, and also says that people with allergies and irritable bowel are likely candidates.
Sarno is right!
My problem was what urologists call non-bacterial prostatitis, neurologists call pudendal nerve entrapment, musculo-skeletal therapists call coccydynia, physical therapists call piriformis syndrome, ... Summarizing, no specialist knew what what the ... was going on with me but all of them claimed that it was something within their field. Moreover, many suggested surgery as the only solution. The pain was very bad and I could not lead a normal life.
Years ago, I read Dr. Sarno's first book and my back problems resolved ""like magic"". But I still had eczema, fibromyalgia, a nighttime anxiety disorder and chronic constipation. Not a fun life, let me tell you. So I literally fell on Sarno's new book The Mindbody Prescription. At first, my conscious mind rebelled at the notion that this was, in essence, a problem of attitude. But I had my success with my back to encourage me so I set about doing the easy mental excercises and was really shocked to find all my symptoms started to vanish. I have had one short spell of fibromyalgia (which I talked my way out of, as outlined in the book), no constipation and far less night anxiety (I never was anxious during the day). The eczema took longer and I still have to remind a few spots of it that ""I know what you're doing so don't bother!"" but it is 90 per cent cleared. Truly, this book is a miracle. I know Dr. Sarno's book won't cure cancer or heart disease but I am entirely convinced that it will help the symptoms and perhaps even make recovery more likely. What a relief! I feel much more in control of my life. I even used the method to get through the recent terrorist attack on New York.
PLEASE read this book, let the message sink in, and KNOW that you have far more control over your own mind and body reactions than you ever thought. I wish Dr. Sarno all the best. Lots of mainstream medical people are going to hate his method because it will revolutionize the medical world.
Like most reviewers, I have had terrific results after reading Dr. Sarno's books, and I am very thankful that I found them after only 2 months of back pain, unlike many of you who talk of suffering for years.
For the skeptics among you, I recommend searching for the study by Maureen Jensen in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study was cited by Dr. Sarno in an interview. They did MRIs on people WITHOUT back pain, and found that a full 52 percent had bulging disks to some degree.
That being said, I still have questions. There was a previous review by a physical therapist who stressed how important it is to not forget the ""body"" when thinking about mind-body problems. After all, it IS possible to injure your muscles through overuse, a slip on the ice, or what have you. The physical body is not invincible.
I'm finding it very difficult to know when a pain that develops after a long run or a hike in the mountains is due to my worrying about the possibility of pain (TMS) and when it is an injury---in other words, is it physical or mental?
For example, the other day I went for a 5km run. In the past, before my short adventure with back pain, I often ran 5kms and enjoyed the tired feeling I got in my muscles the following day. This time, I did a long, slow warm-up, walking the first km, stretched for awhile, and ran. It was really hard to let go and just run like I used to without concentrating on the mechanics of my stride, whether my hamstrings felt tight, and the remote possibility that I might ""hurt myself"", etc. When I got home, I felt some minor shin splints, something that had never happened to me in the past. So I was torn. Should I ice my shins and rest, and treat it as a physical injury, or think about psychological problems and see if the shin pain was just a distraction of my mind? It seems likely to me that my worrying about my stride led me to run in a strange way and tense my shins, leading to a slight physical injury.
Simply Put - It Works.
When my back went, it went all the way. I lost the ability to walk. I could not lift my left foot off the ground and had to drag my left leg behind me. I had to sleep on the floor. It hurt to stand, sit, walk, sneeze, cough - my life was not a happy place. AN MRI revealed a badly herniated L5/S1 disk and the surgeon told me surgery needed to be performed within a week. The risks and potential complications were beyond my belief so I sought alternative methods.
I tried physical therapy, pain medicine, acupuncture, sports medicine, deep tissue massage and chiropractic. I went through procedures I never heard of and never dreamed of participating in. I was only 34 years old and had been extremely active and now it looked like life as I knew it was over.
After suffering a life tragedy about 8 years ago I started having unrelenting, debilitating back pain and spasms. I was given a myriad of tests and prescriptions, went to physical therapy and even when to a pain specialist. After a couple of visits the pain specialist recommended Dr. Sarnos book. I read the book all the way through and went back and reread the areas that pertained to my situation. Over the next few weeks my tension myositis disappeared. I have recommended this book to anyone I know with chronic, debilitating pain.
A few years later after my first pregnancy I suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. After a while I remembered Dr. Sarnos book discussing carpal tunnel. I reread the book and my symptoms eased substantially.
Even if, like I, the pain does not go away I'm positive Dr. Sarnos' insight into the Mind Body connection will help those with chronic pain manage the stress induced symptoms.
I bought and read both The Mindbody Prescription and Dr. Sarno's Healing Back Pain about 1 week after I had suffered a severe back and sciatic pain attack during Christmas of 2007. WHAT a LIFESAVER!!! I can't overstate this for my situation. The pain I had in my back and the sciatic pain that burned and tingled in my left leg was so painful that I could barely walk for 10 days, or even stand to shower. I had x-rays and an MRI which revealed that I had a lower herniated disc. The orthapedic doctors suggest oral cortisone, which I took in 2 5-day packs. That did nothing for me. I then tried Chiropractic adjustments and physical therapy which were unsuccessful as well. Chiropractic care had helped my symptoms in years before , but never went to the source of my pain, which was originating in my brain, not the structure of my spine. Surgery was suggested on my disc, but that was my absolute last resort. I had bought Healing Back Pain years before, but didn't really read all of it. So, I thought I would try it one more time and really digest it.
After reading Healing Back Pain and also reading (and re-reading sections many time to help it sink into my unconscious) The Mindbody Prescription, I followed Dr. Sarno's methods of learning about Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS) and how my pain originated in my brain and wasn't an injury of any sort. My pain was severe and the patterns conditioned in my head took a while to shake. I was functioning and back to work in about a week after I started the books. However, it took me a while to shake the fear of having the attack. With practice and once the concepts sunk into my unconscious mind, I was soon running and lifting weights, probably about 2-3 months after I started the program and books. I'm happy to say that I'm fully recovered now (14 months later) and it probably took about 3-4 months for me to be completely pain-free. Occasionally, I get reminders of pain in my body, but once I realize what is going on in my life or in that moment, I can get the pain to go away in short order. Also, now I know this pain cannot do any damage to my body and is just my brain telling me something.
This man can save your life. Trust me, he saved mine. He is a true pioneer. Most orthopedic surgeons are in the dark ages on this theory and still doing a lot of unnecessary surgery. They are only going by the medical school books which are outdated and teaching the wrong treatment over and over again. Just like ""the world is flat"" theory, it takes a pioneer to come forward and champion new ideas. Dr. Sarno is that pioneer. Don't give up on the books and theories. I had to re-read the book (follow his suggestions in the book) and important sections over and over again, with journaling every day to get my unconscious to be aware of the concepts. Also, purchase Dr. Sarno's DVD lecture which also seemed to help me. It's worth it vs. all the doctor visits and expensive treatments. Good luck and don't give up!
I was a very young boy of 14 the first time my back went out and it continued until I was left paralyzed on my bathroom floor the day of my brothers wedding.
I was flat on my back with no hope of ever being normal. And this was at 26 years old.
I stumbled onto Dr. Sarno;s book and my pain went away in two weeks. No kidding. I was a prisoner of my back for most of my YOUNG life and then after one reading the pain stopped.
And it lasted for ten years.
T two years ago I started feeling pain in my feet and then my back and then my hip. I have re-read the book and can't seem to shake the pain this time. I even stared psychotherapy to vent my unconscious rage. I am still in pain, but I know that it is caused by my unconscious stress and am really making an effort to follow the advice in the book. I have been in pain again for two years, but again, I know it is emotional. I am going to apply his principles religiously again and let you know how I feel in a few weeks.
I had terrible back and leg pain for 7 years. I thought it was due to my house building days and an injury I thought I had received from pulling a boat from the water. An Orthapedic surgeon said he could remove the so-called pinched disc. I chose instead to regularly visit a Chiropractor. Between Chiropractor visits I would consume numerous anti-flammitory pills. I also did Acupunture.
Then I read ""The Mindbody Prescription"" by Dr. Sarno. During the course of reading this book, I could feel the pain easing up as I could relate alot of what he wrote to my situation. After reading it twice, I was virtually pain free. That was two years ago and I have been pain free since.
I highly recommend this book. It is an absolute must-read to cure all types of pain and muscle ailments.
I wouldn't be surprised it Dr. Srano's work leads to cures for other problems, not (yet) listed in his books. I suffered a sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL), and while I would recommend others who experience such a serious condition to follow *all* their doctors instructions (e.g. taking major doses of steroids, etc.), applying Dr. Sarno's technique seemed to help a great deal. Additionally, Dr. Sarno does mention in his earlier back pain book that steroids do seem to help, although he does not know why.
This is a fantasic book and Dr. Sarno has done invaluable, scientifically sound work. Now, how do we make his knowledge work for us; how do we starting applying it right away?
First, a few of the basics. 1. There is no way to utilize Dr. Sarno's research without dealing with the psychology of our unconscious minds. Most people are unfamiliar with this, so it takes some getting used to. If you have any skepticism regarding ""the unconscious brain,"" maybe even doubting its existence, then this will be a barrier for you in benefiting from Dr. Sarno's research. Try to be open-minded and unafraid to own up to your own repressed emotions. A common mistake made by many health professionals is to cite conscious emotions as the cause, or part of the cause, of various health problems. For example, when I handed my doctor a copy of Sarno's book, he said, ""I am already well aware that `stress on the job' is the #1 cause of back pain."" But simply saying ""stress"" or ""tension"" is the culprit misses the point! We have to accept that it is our job to root out the sources of our repressed, uncomfortable feelings that are currently hidden from us.
2. That said, we don't have to change those feelings or make them vanish. Rather, we have to try to bring them to light and, if possible, sit with them. Once our attention is on the emotions, day in and day out, then the purpose of the pain or other distraction fades away.
3. Dr. Sarno's treatment program is not aspirin. You don't pick up his book on the days you hurt and then throw it down when you feel better. Dr. Sarno's books are a long-term means for us to re-think how we understand pain and bodily disorders (turns out that most of them are not pathological). Without diligently following through on this re-thinking process, future relaspe is a matter of course.
4. No matter how bad your bodily problems are (and there are hundreds that could be at work), they are not the real problems. Let me say that again, the pain is not your biggest worry! It is so easy to wistfully think, ""If only I were well, then my life would be perfect."" I'm sorry, but that's not true. Rather, once you are well, you are then more able to focus on the anxiety, anger, low self-esteem, and past events that deserved your attention from the very beginning. In so far as you avoid these subjects, you encourage any available distraction that your brain might utilize to boost your complacency. Be strong and don't give up!  This is the basis of the therapy. It is like homework. But really, it is medicine. The 15-30 minute sessions allow you to gradually absorb what Dr. Sarno has said, apply it to your own unique life, and talk to your brain. You have to banish the fear of physical disorders with facts and those facts need time to sink in. Plus, you have to develop new habits of mental reflection. It takes a lot of patience and maybe sounds bizarre, but we ought to consider how little we know about this field of mind-body medicine. No one is expected to be good at it right away.
Strategies to use for self-therapy during your morning/evening sessions: take notes on ways that you put pressure on yourself, write down things that come to mind so you can review them many times. Talk to your brain. If you can lecture to your brain cogently, then you probably have Dr. Sarno's findings well summarized. Re-read sections of his books. Watch the videos available (Mumbleypeg Productions). Balance your reflection sessions. Don't just review the concepts of mind-body medicine. Be careful also to do sincere emotional exploration. It's easy to avoid (heck, the whole program is easy to avoid). And, it's easy to focus on just one aspect (say, your relationship with a specific family member). But there are many possible aspects. Most of them quite unspectacular when compared to trauma and abuse, for example. Trauma and abuse might be the case for you, but there's no need to have a troubled past to suffer severely. Just being a mature adult provides more than enough for a full ""mental closet.""
Don't let the turkeys get you down. Few people will understand what you are doing during your morning and evening sessions. And, you might have to continue for many months. No need to worry. You get to learn more about yourself and your emotional reactions. Believe it or not, but it's truly a great opportunity. As Freud said, ""Being totally honest with ourselves is a very beneficial exercise."" Are *you* willing to be honest about, say, inner anger toward loved ones? It's no easy pill to swallow, but you aren't the first. Human psychology has its shocking revelations, but we all share them.
Consider that a real revision of our understanding of health is in order. Starting with stress, it is important to note that stress is basically universal. To be a normal mature adult is to endure stress. However, accusing someone of being ""stressed out"" often evokes hostile reactions. We are taught that experiencing stress equals a failure to properly cope and deal with one's life. But don't be lied to! Alas, misinformation abounds and we are lied to regularly (yes, doctors will provide lab results about, say your poor adrenal glands. But don't take that malarkey. This is about your brain, not your body). The name of the game is not to magically live a stress-free life. That ain't possible! Rather, it's to admit the stress, point it out, bring it to light, and take the drama out of it. Sure, none of your friends might be doing this, but they probably don't know the wisdom that Dr. Sarno has collected for us, either.
He didn't tell me about the peace of mind that would come, and I'm rather upset about that...
I was lying in bed this morning, terrible abdominal pain in my gut, and I started using Dr. John Sarno's instructions (page 139 in this book, and on page 70 in his ""Healing Back Pain"" book) instead of reaching for a Vicodin as I usually do. I first started running down all the instances of rage in my life. It was overwhelming. As I went through each experience and tried my best to forgive and release it, the pain got worse. That told me unquestionably that there was a relationship between the emotions and the pain.
In one instance in my life where I had rage due to an intolerable work situation, I also had surgery to remove two herniated discs during that period of my life. This was not a coincidence.
Based on the amount of rage I saw in my mind, I realized this was going to take a while. After I came to that realization, I just decided to be patient with it, and chip away at it a little each day. I also prayed for guidance as to how to best forgive and release this rage that I didn't want in my life anymore.
 Where a small amount of rage was removed, peace filled in the empty space vacated by the rage. I didn't expect that. After a brief nap, the pain had subsided enough for me to get out bed and start my day.
The effects of the employing the concepts in this book have been a dream come true for me. I had suffered from chronic pain problems for over 15 years. It started out as lower back pain, which then spread to become chronic shoulder tendinitis, upper back and neck pain, and then elbow and wrist pain as well. Over the years, my lifestyle gradually changed from being very active and in great shape to being unable to walk in one mile without extreme pain. The lower back pain was diagnosed as a degenerated disc for which I had two fusion surgeries in 1998 and 2001. My shoulder problems were supposedly caused by excess laxity in the ligaments and led me to have surgery on both of my shoulders. As is apparently common with TMS, the surgeries would help for a while, and then the pain would return, worse than ever. I tried everything: physical therapy (more sessions than I can possibly remember), chiropractic, VAX-D disc decompression therapy, acupuncture, rolfing, trigger point therapy, McKenzie, Egosque, steroid injections etc. Some of these techniques helped for a while, but the pain would always return as viscious as ever. I came to conclude I suffered from chronic myofascial pain syndrome and was told by ""medical professionals"" that the best I could hope for was to control it and would never be fully functional again.
Thank God I was unwilling to accept these dire assessments. I actually read Dr. Sarno's book 4 or 5 years ago and dismissed it without giving it a real chance. It was only when I was truly desperate that I picked it up again in December, 2002 with an open mind. Within one week or so I noticed the pain was diminished. Amazingly, within 4-5 weeks, the pain was nearly gone. So then I started to exercise again and initially the pain came back, but I assured myself the pain had nothing to do with any kind of muscle inflammation or joint problem, and was only being caused by my subconscious. Sure enough, I continued to expand my workouts and now four months after applying the technique, I am in great shape, working out nearly every day, and in virtually no pain.
If you are in chronic pain, read this book, it is all true. Do not allow ""medical professionals"" to tell you you have chronic myofascial pain syndrome or some other crock of nonsense. Dr. Sarno is right that they have created an army of partially disabled people that in fact have nothing wrong with them.

This is a very interesting book with an interesting premise. The author states that all pain in your body that persists after injury, or even without injury, is caused by unresolved emotional pain. We hypnotists have been saying this for years, but his cure is a little different. He says that your mind thinks it is easier for you to have physical pain, and is protecting you from having to relive those traumatic memories by distracting you with intense pain.
Blaming th victim! Pure crap!
While I certainly agree that a negative attitude can impact an illness and that having a positive forward thinking attutide and not a self-defeating one is very important in treatment the idea that negative thouths or attitude can cause illnes is total bunk! I've been striken with 3 auto immune illnesses for 11 years now and I was happy and healthy before them- I didn't have any negative attitudes UNTIL I became ill and in constant daily unthinkable pain! Who is this author to talk about something that he has no first hand knowlage of!!!
While there is no lab lest for Fibro (or CFS) there is an elevated level of subsance P in the spinal fluid in Fibro patients, as well as several other scientif studies confirming it;s scientific existnace. It's not IN OUR HEADS!!!!
THIS WORKS !
I was cured of carpal tunnel, back and knee pain, plantar fascitis, most of my hip pain, etc., etc.
If you are having chronic pain issues that are not the result of an injury or real disease then this is the book for you !
This book has helped my sister and my best friend!
Dr. John Sarno's book ""The MindBody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain"" is invaluable. I first bought Sarno's book titled ""Healing Back Pain"" for my mother in South Africa and learned that stress, tension and psychological factors can cause back pain and migraines. Since I have chronic migraines I bought his later book ""The MindBody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain."" His thinking is of course outside mainstream medicine. Sarno found that strong emotions generated in the unconscious mind, particularly rage, cause the mind to create a more socially acceptable physical distraction. The brain does this by reducing the blood flow and thus the proper amount of oxygen to the tissues involved. He says the change in the muscles, nerves and tendons account for 90% of the pain. He calls it TMS-Tension Myositis Syndrome as it is a physical disorder caused by tension in muscles, nerves, tendons and ligaments. The pain from the TMS takes our attention away from the emotional trauma and instead of dealing with our repressed feelings we focus on our body.
Treatment involves looking at what was going on in our life when the pain started and identifying repressed feelings from the past.
An experience I had makes me think what Sarno says is true. When my half sister and her husband, from South Africa, lived with me for five months they bought a car that had engine problems that only got seven miles to the gallon to tour America. I was concerned about their car purchase but did not say anything. I developed severe neck and back pain and could not turn my head for a week. I shared my concern about their car at a Co-Dependency group meeting and to my surprise I became very tearful. As I spoke the ache in my neck evaporated like vapor. I later joked with them and said, ""You're a pain in the neck!""
I fit perfectly with the personality characteristics common in people with TMS-conscientious, responsible, perfectionistic with a strong need to please and to be helpful and good. And as Sarno says these tendencies have lead to tension and anxiety and physical problems.
When I looked for repressed anger when the migraines started I discovered that I felt extremely rejected, betrayed and used by my sister and brother-in-law at that time. Once I identified the repressed anger and sadness I started to grieve. It was like going through a divorce. Now I see we had different expectations for our relationship back then. I thought of us as a family. They wanted to immigrate to America and saw me as their ticket to get established.
When my stepfather heard I was angry he said, ""Why don't you float your negative feelings in a paper boat down your creek? I thought I had! Now I see that Sarno's views are more helpful. Sarno says, ""We are frail beings with brains strongly influenced by childish, illogical, reactions and dependency needs. Most of us carry feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, humiliation, shame and anger at ourselves for not living up to our own expectations and rage at others for perceived hurt and betrayals. The brain-mind is a conglomeration of thoughts and feelings that are often at odds with each other. It is not the neat, well organized, logical organ we would like it to be."" Thanks to Sarno I've decided it's all right to be illogical and childish. It's part of being human and it is universal and if it means getting rid of my migraines and rage and becoming a better person in the end, then so much the better.
To help people recognize that their mind, rather than a physical abnormality is the source their pain Sarno's treatment program involves lectures, group meeting and psychotherapy, if necessary. Patients are encouraged to discontinue all physical therapy, resume all physical activity, and review the 10 daily reminders: I have no structural abnormality only mild oxygen deprivation;-I have a harmless condition caused by repressed emotion (mostly anger);-TMS exists to distract me from emotions;-I have nothing to fear;-my physical aching is not dangerous;-I will not be concerned or intimidated by pain;-I will shift my attention from pain to emotional issues;-I intend to be in control-not my subconscious mind;-I must think psychological, not physical.
Sarno has treated more than 11,000 patients with chronic pain-many of whom have suffered for years. He estimates he's cured more than 90% of them and has helped thousands of patients overcome pain without drugs or surgery.
I have not even finished reading this book yet, and already, I am feeling a lot less pain. I am a 27-year-old woman. I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, abdominal wall pain, and irritable bowel syndrome. I have been through physical therapy, special diets, and a chronic pain clinic, not to mention a boatload of painkillers.
I never thought I would get better. The pain has been a part of my life since age 19, and since then, I've had to accept more and more limitations.
Now, I am finally shedding those limitations. My mother saw Dr. Sarno a few weeks ago, and when she came home, she told me about his work. I was very interested, so I began reading this book.
There was no big miracle, and I am not trying to lead anyone to believe that reading this will instantly ""cure"" them. However, as I read, I noticed that the pain was dissipating slightly. I began to think more about what could be causing rage in my unconscious mind, as Sarno suggested; and I wrote about some of it, which really helped. I have continued this process of reading, thinking, and writing; and my pain has lessened significantly.
The emotional pain has been difficult to bear. It is easy to tell why the unconscious mind would want to keep these things hidden under a veneer of more ""socially acceptable"" physical pain.
Ultimately, though, facing these emotions will become easier, and I will be free to have a life again. I can go back to work, and maybe eventually work full time. And I have hope again. I want to eventually get back into kickboxing, and do all sorts of things that I thought I would either never get a chance to do, or never do again.
1) I had the type of RSI where there is no pathology behind it. There was and is absolutely no evidence of structural damage anywhere in my arms, to the extent that my Doctor almost implied that I was wasting his time! It made no sense to me that such great pain could be caused my no damage or weakness of muscle fibres in my arms whatsoever. Dr. Sarno's theory can explain effectively why this is.
2) I did understand why both my arms went out in sympathy. I played guitar, where both hands are doing something different. Why should the pain be exactly equal?
3) People often told me I wasn't as physically strong as other people as a reason for being more affected by RSI. But in experience, the weight, height, build and to an extent general physical health had no correlation between those who got affected. Tellingly, I was perplexed that people who had a certain type of personality appeared to be more susceptible to RSI.
4) I did not understand how sleep greatly increased my pain in my arms, whilst for other RSI sufferers with no pathology behind it, evening before they went to bed were the worst.
My physican ""prescribed"" this book for me. I have suffered with chronic hives and deep edema for over ten years and have tried every kind of doctor and specialist I could find. I've had many tests and alternative treatments and a dizzying array of prescriptions. Nothing worked for long.
I suppose it is normal to be skeptical of the claims Dr. Sarno makes (and I am corroborating) regarding the power of the mind to heal the body. All I can say is that out of sheer desperation I tried it and it worked for me. It has worked for many others as well, and it just might be the answer you need to your pain/health problem.
If you're serious about healing, this is the real deal.
There are many ways I can review this book and it's theories. However, it all comes down to one simple understanding. Dr. John Sarno is absolutely correct. It's unbelievable that more people have not discovered this way of healing their individiual ailments.
So much money, time, and energy is wasted on drugs and ""other"" treatments,(doctors whom insist almost any ailment MUST be treated with drugs or ""physical"" treatment). Please don't misunderstand my point. If you fall out of a tree and break your leg, then of course you will need the care of a doctor and his prescribed medication. Or, if (God forbid) you aquire cancer or some other form of sickness that requires medical attention, obviously you need the proper attention. My point is that day to day, chronic pain in the body can be cured simply by John Sarno's discovery.
I am not endorsed nor do I have any affiliation with Sarno. I'm a 40 year old man that battled back pain along with awful sciatica for years and years. After trying the standard chiropractic road (and others mind you), my conditions only got worse. And, I was paying a hefty bill to these ""doctors"". Once more, they would even prescribe or ""recommend"" some sort of pill that was supposed to ""help"".
Finally, my wife and I discovered John Sarno and his theories. She (my wife) was battling a bad case of Fibromyalgia and she was only 35 years old. We were both very concerned for her future being she did not want every joint in her body aching the rest of her life (a common symptom of Fibromyagia). She saw numerous ""doctors"" that gave us the complete runaround and standard line--""Take 2 to 3 Advil a day and that should help. Limit your activities and get lots of rest"".
 We both enjoyed exercising and her condition severely limited most activities. She decided to read John Sarno's book. She read it over, and over, and over, and over again (which I highly recommend in order to fully understand). Literally ingraining it into her head. Then, also decided to take Sarno's advice and do the opposite of what the other ""doctors"" prescribed.
We both began exercising. Sometimes, literally, this was painful. However, and this is the magic part, the pain eventually went away. I'll say it again. THE PAIN EVENTUALLY WENT AWAY. Just as Sarno said it would.
The mind has an unbelievable knack for dictating how we feel physically. Dr. John Sarno has figured out how this occurs and causes the back pain, neck pain, joint pain, headache pain we all are subject to day after day. Every day, life will deal us situations and instances that are the recipe for TMS(Tension Myositis Syndrome). It's how WE DECIDE TO HANDLE IT that is the difference.
-are you pain free with the so called ""treatments"" you are getting? And if so, how long?
-does your pain return just like that for no reason?
-do you notice a pattern of where and when the pain occurs?
-do you find certain events or instances make your pain worse?
-and finally, if the ""treatments"" you're currently recieving work, then why does the pain come back?
This book decribes and explaines why we hurt. And, how to get over it--for good! If you are serious, and I mean serious, about curing your ailment, Dr. John Sarno and his books can help.
Yeah, Right, Like This'll Work!
If you're like me, you've heard about Dr. Sarno's book and his philosophy on healing certain pains and disorders and you said to yourself with much sarcasm, ""Yeah, right, like this'll work!"" Well, I'm here to say, yeah, indeed right...this works!
In these tough times I've been under a bit more pressure at work, and pressure at work means often that the stress comes home with me. A huge mistake that of course only adds to the tension I am so trying to eliminate. So my philosophy was try not to think about the stress, and things will be fine.
Then suddenly a few months ago I started developing a pain in my upper back and lower neck. I'm thinking, geez, I must have pulled something or I'm just getting old. The pain persists and gets worse. Some days I strain to even move my head. I'm thinking that I better go see a doctor, but I know the outcome of that: MRIs, catscans, maybe physical therapy, maybe pills, even surgery???...All expensive and undesirable alternatives.
So for years I've had a friend that has sworn by Dr. Sorno's book and the philosophy of self healing through thought. So for under 20 bucks for the book I figured what have I got to lose? On the contrary: I had everything to gain.
After applying the principles that Dr. Sorno discusses in The Mindbody Prescription: Healing the Body, Healing the Pain, I live a different life.
First, let me say, folks, that this is no cult, religion or anything like that. It may sound too easy, but this is simply taking the concept of understanding that you (may) have a condition called Tension Myositis Syndrome (TMS), accepting that you have the condition and following an extremely simple process that Dr. Sorno clearly and concisely lays out in about 30 pages in the third part of this book to expel the TMS.
I say simple, but everyone's different. It was simple for me. So simple that I could easily summarize a simple 5-minute mind exercise inspired by this book--Not meditating...or is it? Whatever.--that I try to do every day that I attribute to eliminating my neck pain, and in addition, making me more at peace with stressful situations that occur in my day to day life.
Bottom line: Within a very short period of finishing Dr. Sorno's book...I believe my life is better...on several levels. And I thought that the only people that say that kind of thing are, well, cuckoo. Okay...I may be cuckoo, but I feel great! Buy this book. Its principles apply to a lot more than just back pain. I was just lucky enough to have back pain in order to be led to this book.
The human anatomy is a marvelous organism, adapted to the ways of the world over hundreds of thousands of years, and extremely capable of self-correcting the damage in 95% of the injuries and disorders to which the body is susceptible--from whiplash to carpal tunnel syndrome to fibromyalgia to chronic fatigue syndrome to (more controversially) helicobacter pylori bacteria, hiatal hernias and Lyme disease. What about those folks who live in chronic pain, well beyond the normal limits of the body's requirements for healing itself? Will they stand to being told their pain is not ""real""? Slim chance--in fact, the author would no doubt agree with them: their pain is real enough. But if the basis of the disorder is undiagnosable, or unmeasurable as far as the usual tests are concerned, then perhaps it's time to look with more than casual interest into the territory of the subconscious--its contents; its subversive, frequently irrational motives; its self-protective scenarios and clever evasive tactics.
In other words, Sarno questions whether the physician's common diagnosis for so-called ""functional illnesses""--""somataform disorder""--is of any more use to anyone than the out-of-favor term ""psychosomatic."" The former term simply applies a specific, impressive-sounding name to a vague EFFECT; the latter at least attaches the word to a mind-body connection implicating a CAUSE.
Sarno's conclusions are often more suggestive than conclusive, his claims of cures more conspicuous that the methodology by which to achieve the cure or stop the pain (it's hard to take overly seriously the back-cover testimonials of relief experienced by celebrities ranging from Howard Stern to Anne Bancroft, at least based on the limited evidence in this book). Nevertheless, the author's notions frequently make sense, and if, to the displeasure of some, they reclaim the wisdom of Freud, perhaps it's high time the towering Viennese intellectual be taken seriously in ways other than vilification.
Watching PBS trot out another medicine man at public television fund-raising time, prescribing everything from vitamins to fish oil to St. John's Wort to amino acids to Effexor and Wellbutrin in order to ""change the structure of the brain"" (those nasty chemical imbalances of the brain, addressed through altering the neurotransmitters--and now it's extended to the gut--those unfriendly bacteria, addressed by eating the right manufacturer's yogurt with the right friendly bacteria) is enough to make you question the quality of the information that is currently being dispensed as a ""public service"" to the community.
Knowledge is power, and for that reason Sarno's book is at least a useful beginning toward a lasting prescription for extinguishing seemingly endless, all-but-life-ending pain. If you're a doubter, there are some rather simple tests to put Sarno's (and Freud's) ideas to the test.  Now think of someone you love or feel dependent on--a parent, a dog or cat, an only son or daughter. Imagine receiving without the least bit of preparation a message in the middle of the night informing you of the worst--the unthinkable. Now imagine the degree to which those aches and pains of just a few minutes ago matter to you, deserving to reclaim prime-time real estate in the subconscious territory formerly reserved for its sole VIP resident. Granted, the pain may be no less, but isn't it remarkable how it travels to other places, making itself felt in entirely different ways?
emotional well-being. It was recommended to me when I was in excruciating shoulder pain, from which I am now completely healed, but it has also had a radical effect on me in other ways. I used to obsess over all kinds of physical symptoms, convinced that there was something wrong with me that the doctors weren't able to find. Thanks to Dr. Sarno, I'm now able to stop obsessing, and look for emotional causes.
1. Dr. Sarno makes it absolutely clear that experiencing psychosomatic symptoms like pain do not mean that you are crazy or neurotic; rather, they are a normal, unconscious response that everyone experiences at some time and in some form.
2. There is not the slightest bit of touchy-feely woo-hoo in this book. Dr. Sarno is actually a very scientific, logical kind of thinker, and came to his conclusions because they make the most logical sense after years and years of experience treating patients.
Book was effective. The discussions helped to release stress that had a positive impact on back pain.
I followed the prescription for stomach pain, and it worked...
quick comment: I bought this book on a whim and it worked. Thank goodness I gave it a try. I'm back to my normal life style after 2 years of pain controlling my every move...
I'm doing EVEN BETTER now. I bought so many copies to give to friends I've lost track. I've helped 2 people get better JUST BY TALKING TO THEM and using Dr. Sarno's theories in my discussions. I have been helping many of my friends get better, and I have gotten better at recognizing when TMS starts, and I don't get afraid of it. I focus on the stress in my life. The psychological. I feel like such a better person now. I'm able to communicate with others better than ever. Thank you Dr. Sarno.
I gave a full recital in December (I'm a cellist). I haven't done that for three years. All my friends who knew what I went through came and were really blown away at the improvement I made.
I'm doing fine, except I have a bad case of the ""symptom imperative"" that Sarno mentions. First, I had horrible sweating that replace my RSI. When I didn't have sweating, I had headaches. When I didn't have headaches, my calf muscles ached. When they stopped aching, my sweating came back, etc on and on.
I'm a physical therapist with 20 years experience in treating patients with low back pain, neck pain, and other various pain problems and if everybody would accept this information I would be looking for a job. After five years of chronic low back pain, I was completely painfree in two week after accepting my back pain was due to repressed emotions and not some type of structural problem. And yes by the way I do try to tell my patients now about the process but most will not accept it.
I know at first the whole process sounds like a bunch of bull, but let me tell you there is a huge body of scientific research linking stress to back pain. Just think for a minute about all the great strides of modern medicine and then think how bad that same modern medicine is at curing back pain. That's because doctors and therapists are focused on the wrong problem. Doctors and therapists blame various structural problems when the real culprit is stress, pressure, and repressed emotions. Your back does not hurt because you are weak, inflexible, or malaligned it hurts because life is full of stress and pressure. I know because I lived it too.
Dr. Sarno does a great job of explaining all this and makes a strong argument against traditional treatments. He explains how acceptance is critical not by blind faith but by knowledge and logic. He is truly one of the great thinkers of our time.
If you have suffered from back or neck pain, then this book is a must read. Dr. Sarno has practiced at NYU for many years and has helped numerous patients overcome these physical ailments. The book is clearly written with many examples, which helps the reader to understand the principles and identify whether these apply to him/her. Dr. Sarno works with the concept TMS, tension myositis syndrome, which is used to explain how pain (or other sensory problems) can occur in various parts of the body for no clear (conscious) reasons. He reviews the details of TMS repeatedly throughout the book, again using many examples from actual patients.
Dr. Sarno explains that many people experience relief of the pain through insight and coming to understand that their mind (brain) is responsible for the pain. Essentially, unconscious anger (and other emotions) create the physical response by decreasing blood flow and oxygen to the painful areas of the body. As the mind heals, so does the body. Dr. Sarno helps to heal the mind through this book by educating the reader about TMS and this process. Furthermore, he helps the reader understand that the pain is real (not imagined) and has an actual physical cause (i.e., reduction of oxygen) which is not dangerous or permanent. By reading the book, the mind's process for causing the pain is exposed and now rendered useless in distracting the patient from the underlying causes (i.e., anger). Therefore, the pain should decrease and stop altogether once this genuine insight is gained by the reader.
I noticed most of the negative comments come from folks who don't have problems and have never had to face these situations. How do I know? Because I was one of them. An engineer by trade, I'm very left brained. But serious illness and the futility of conventional medicine in treating chronic conditions sends you searching. I also have researched much of the ""science"" out there coming from the drug companies. There's no money (patents) in mindbody medicine, so don't hold your breath for huge announcments from the medical establishment in this area. And if studies are done (of which there are many, by the way), the biased editors of the journals funded by the pharmaceutical industry will forthwith throw them out. Don't be too enamored by ""impartial science"". There is no such thing nowadays.
Dr. Sarno has hit the nail on the head in terms of understanding the source of many of our ailments. My wife has had aches and pains all over ever since we were married. She had a rough childhood and has a lot of emotional baggage. She has been 'diagnosed' with many structural issues as the source of her pain. However, by paying close attention to when the pain and other symptoms start, we have been able to recognize the emotional source of the pain and neutralize them using some emotional release techniques. An activity that has caused her back pain for a very long time no longer does. Every time she exercised, her knee would lock up. We identified the emotional reasons for this (fear of being in shape, losing weight, etc.), and the knee pain disappeared.",http://fastbrowser.net/zzB000FA5SJS.htm
"Understanding political accountability in a strong...
Purpose: Research was conducted to investigate whether, and how, political accountability might stabilise when agents are faced with profound changes in external structures such as competition laws and austerity policies.
Design/methodology/approach: We performed a field study from 2007 to 2015 in a regional hub in Finland and worked with data from document analysis, interviews and meeting observations. We have used embedded research design, where we apply methodological bracketing as well as composite sequence analysis for field research.
Findings: Accountability declined when irresistible external structures were the dominant influence on the unreflective actions of agents-in-focus. With time, however, the agents started acting critically by drawing on structures that could facilitate strategic actions to stabilise political accountability.
Research limitations/implications: The field research and interpretation of the data were limited to the organisation analysed; however, the theoretical arguments allow for analytical generalisations.
Practical implications: The research demonstrates how public officials and political decision-makers can eventually adopt a strategic approach when faced with irresistible change in external structures.
Social implications: The research demonstrates how public officials and political decision-makers can eventually adopt a strategic approach when faced with irresistible changes in external structures.
Originality/value: The study locates political accountability in the context of strong structuration theory and discusses how it is redefined by external structures.

"What is a Honeypot ?
In recent years, the Internet of Things has seen strong growth in the world of ""everything connected"".
It is therefore logical to expect a massive evolution of cyber-attacks against this type of equipment based on the observations of recent years. The more objects connected to the internet, the more attack there will be.
In order to study the behavior of attackers, to discover security flaws and new types of malware, it is necessary to set up malicious behavior analysis systems.
As I said before, it is necessary to set up systems to study the behavior of the attackers.
This is where a system called Honeypot comes in.
A Honeypot is a computer system for the purpose of ""luring"" attackers by simulating the behavior of a real system. The goal is to expose machines on the internet (often, they are virtual machines in a specially dedicated network that are used), and to ""monitor"" them to retrieve information about the attackers: their action, the vulnerabilities of security of exposed systems, etc.
Of course, the system should not arouse the suspicion of the attacker: They must not realize that it is a honeypot.
All communications established with a honeypot are considered suspicious: legitimate users have no reason to access them.
Honeypots with low interaction have a low level of interaction and often consist of emulate operating systems and services. Activity is therefore limited to the degree of emulation offered by the honeypot.
Thus, these honeypots offer few privileges to the intruder who will have a limited scope. Thus a low interaction honeypot only offers false services that do not return never no answer. For example, the Honeypot can emulate an FTP service on port 21, but emulate only the login command, or emulate other commands. The pirate tries to to connect to these services and to execute orders there (such services may resemble a listening socket that only logs the different packets it receives).
The fact that the hacker does not receive an answer is not a problem in some cases because he can always see the result of his order. With this type of honeypot the hacker never really interacts with the system hosting the false services. The security of the system is maintained provided that the security rules are also applied to false services.
An evolution of low interaction Honeypots, allows emulated services to send back mostly fake answers to pirates so as to give him some leads or to confuse him without necessarily intriguing him. This implementation requires a very good knowledge of the protocols relating to fake services. It is therefore quite difficult to put in place.
Honeypots with strong interaction are different because they often involve the use of real operating systems and real applications. This is not about emulation, we provides the attacker with something real. The risks are many since our machine is intended to be compromised.
One of the advantages of this solution is that it is possible to obtain a lot of information, because as attackers have access to real systems, one can examine all of their behavior, and thus analyze their methods and the tools they use, whether they are new or not.
The second advantage is that this type of Honeypot does not make any assumptions about the likely behavior of an attacker and captures everything he can. This type of environment so lets discover new methods of attack that were not yet suspected.
Nevertheless there is an increased risk that the attacker can use the real systems of the Honeypot to attack other systems that are not Honeypots. These Honeypots can do anything Honeypots with low interaction can do. Moreover. On the other hand, they are more complicated to put in place and manage.
The use of a Honeypot can be applied in two different environments: production environment, and research environment.
The main objective of a production honeypot is to verify that the security measures are applied. It also protects the real production systems: in fact, if you expose a machine with known vulnerabilities, the attacker will go more easily to it than to a production system. This allows somehow to ""lure""
Generally, production-oriented honeyports are used by organizations that want to improve the protection of their network, discover vulnerabilities in their applications, and enhance their ability to detect attacks.
Research Honeypots are a bit more complex to set up as they aim to collect as much information about attackers and their procedures as possible.
The main goal is to discover new vulnerabilities in exposed systems and services, and new malware.
What are the most attacked ports ?
What are the actions most often performed by the attackers ?
Which services are the most sought after (telnet, ftp, ...)?
Of which countries come the biggest attacks ?
What combinations of login / password are the most used ?
and more others...
This information will be published and will allow companies to better prepare their systems and strengthen their security by applying certain measures.

"When you are brought in as a potential suspect related to an ongoing criminal investigation, you may be asked to be part of a criminal lineup. You should avoid being a part of one when possible due to the potential things that can go wrong. Here is what you should know about being involved in a criminal lineup.
Anybody that has watched a crime movie or television show is well aware of what a criminal lineup is. Multiple suspects are brought in and told to stand next to each other. A witness will then be asked if anybody in the lineup looks like the suspect in the criminal investigation.
Unfortunately, there are things that the police can do that encourage inaccurate identification from the witness. This includes not using decoy lineup participants that resemble the suspect being identified. For example, if you are short with blonde hair, then there should be other people in the criminal lineup that are also short with blonde hair.
The police should never allow multiple witnesses to view the criminal lineup together. One witness can potentially influence another witness into selecting the same person, especially if they say they are confident they have identified the suspect. Police can also do things that subconsciously identify their prime suspect to a witness. This can include telling the witness that the prime suspect is in the criminal lineup, making them feel forced to select somebody.
As an alternative to a criminal lineup, a photo array may be requested as a way to identify a suspect. Several photos are presented to a witness for them to identify the suspect. This method can also provide inaccurate identification due to several factors.
Studies have shown that showing a witness multiple photos at once can cause inaccurate identification. This is because the brain naturally wants to make comparisons and choices, and witnesses feel pressured to select a suspect. On the flip side, showing a witness photos one after the other can cause somebody to select a suspect early on, and then not want to admit they were wrong and change their mind if a more accurate looking suspect is shown later.
If you are being requested as part of a criminal lineup, ask to speak with an attorney (such as one from Kassel & Kassel A Group of Independent Law Offices) before doing so. They will be able to fight on your behalf to make sure you are not part of it or help ensure it is done fairly. This means having an impartial party present suspects to witnesses so that no bias is shown.",http://wilsonlawfirmpllc.com/2015/10/19/what-you-should-know-about-criminal-lineups/
"From the ancient times, conflagrations burned out the downtown of Kyoto. There are no store buildings that are more than 200 or 300 years old, even if they have survived the fires. Most of the historic buildings are shrines and temples. Excellent buildings are designated for a national treasure. Some buildings keep ancient structures and appearances even if they were reconstructed in recent times. As for the gardens accompanying the buildings, in Kyoto and its suburbs, there survive the representative works of the different historical periods, showing the main stream of the age so that people can study the real history of Japanese garden. The temple Sanjusangen-do in the Higashiyama ward in Kyoto is famous for its one thousand life-size statues of Kannon, but it is also significant as a site reminding of the retired Emperor Go-shirakawa. As a historic site of the Muromachi period, if you visit the Golden Pavilion (founded by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu) or the Silver Pavilion (founded by Ashikaga Yoshimasa), you can see the shadow of glory of the time. Such works shows us the correct images of history and arts, as a legacy of the ancestors.
In Kyoto, a comparably large number of Zen temples survive the long history. In the Kamakura period, Zen Buddhism was introduced to Japan and as its first center the temple Kennin-ji was founded. From that time, lots of Zen temples were built, including Tofuku-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenryu-ji, Shokoku-ji, Daitoku-ji and Myoshin-ji. There was a network of state-sponsored Zen temples, called “Gozan” (five mountain system) in Kyoto, and in Kamakura, too. In Kyoto, large temples were built one after another. If not chosen for the five mountains, such temples wished to be included in the system. There were arguments on the ranks of the temples in the system. These conditions made the system so complicated, but it suggests that people recognized the importance of Zen temples in Kyoto. We should also note that the Zen monks introduced the literature of Song and Yuan Dynasties, Neo-Confucianism of Cheng Zhu school and the black and white aquarelles. In Zen temples, from architectural style to altar fittings, everything was so new and unusual. In the previous period, people had never seen such things. One of the first introduced in this period was “Shoin-zukuri,” which is an architectural style for houses to treat guests. It was the age of continual wars and the only comfort for people was the tea ceremony, which was invented in Zen temples, too. Ikebana, Yokyoku or Noh theater are also related with Zen Buddhism in some ways. As interior decorations, the painting on partitions made a remarkable progress. Even today, you can see a considerable number of masterpieces of the painting with gold or the aquarelle of black and white for partitions in the Shoin room of Zen temples. Since sufficient light comes into the Shoin room, the black and white aquarelle on the partitions or the plastered walls looks clearer and more graceful. One side of the Shoin room faces the garden so that the visitor may feel refreshing atmosphere. In a lapse of time, this style of Zen architecture was applied for houses of secular persons. Today, every traditional house has a parlor called Zashiki with an alcove, which are originated from the Shoin room in Zen temples.
Zen temples in Kyoto keep treasures like portraits of priests, calligraphic artworks, masterpiece paintings imported from Song or Yuan Dynasties China as well as partition paintings, excellent structure of the building and the garden. Such temples as Tofuku-ji and Daitoku-ji are especially famous for this. In the Muromachi period, a number of Zen monks were known to people for their poetic, Confucian, historical or medical literature in addition to Buddhist studies. Ancient books of such disciplines are kept in Zen temples, too. Printing arts, which remarkably developed from the mid Heian period, accepted the Chinese style, brought with Zen culture, to produce prints called Gozan prints. Such prints included poetic, Confucian and historical literatures as well as Zen books. Licensed trade with Ming Dynasty China brought such books to this country, but it was so insufficient for the demand that they were reprinted in Japan if demanded. Printing workers from Fuzhou in China participated the business to produce as good prints as Chinese. In particular, the prints called the Rinsen-ji version was excellent. They were manufactured under the supervision of the monk Shunnoku Myoha, who was a disciple of the monk Muso Soseki. Most of such prints were lost, but you can see some survivors today.
Apart from Zen temples, in Kyoto, a considerable number of temples are of the Jodo Shu and Nichiren Shu schools. They also have a lot of treasures. In Kyoto, regardless of their schools (Tenadai, Shingon or Ji shu), old temples have precious wares and treasures, some of which are designated for a national treasure or an important artwork by the government. Among them, however, temples of the Jodo Shinshu, a comparatively new school, may not have so many historical works, but still such temples as Nishi Hongan-ji, Higashi Hongan-ji, Bukko-ji or the former Honsei-ji have master works including imperial handwritings. The structure of Nishi Hongan-ji contains a part of the Fushimi Castle and the Jurakudai palace, as a survivor of the Momoyama architecture, constructed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. They are designated for a national treasure.
In Kyoto, most of the surviving artworks are medieval or early-modern ones. In this way, the city has incomparable cultural heritage. However, Kyoto is the second to Nara in the heritage of the upper antiquity before the 8th century.

"by 1921 the country had become three, with Pakistan and Bangladesh split from India in the north. Now, about a sixth of the world's population is Indian, living in a world that stretches from the tropical southern tip upwards to the heights of the Himalayas, the world's most lofty mountain range, 3200km (2000 miles) to the north. The Golden Triangle - Delhi and the magnificent monuments of Agra and Jaipur-is perhaps the best known part of the country to outsiders.
The rock art tradition of India has been traced to about 40,000 years ago in the Palaeolithic at Bhimbetaka in Central India and other sites. The first permanent settlements in South Asia appeared about 9,000 years ago. This indigenous culture developed into the Indus Valley civilization (also referred to by some as the Sindhu-Sarasvati Tradition), which was at its height from around 2600 BC to 1900 BC and was one of the earliest civilizations.

Visit between November and March, when the temperatures range from 40-60 F/5-15 C in the north (with Kashmir and Ladakh being cooler) to 65-85 F/19-30 C in the south. March-June is dry and hot (85-110 F/30-44 C), and the monsoons come June-October, washing out the roads tourists are likely to travel. The best times to visit mountain destinations such as Darjeeling are March and April, October and November. The spring and summer are too hot for any outdoor activity, except for the hill stations, where temperatures range from 60-70 F/ 15-21 C. Temperatures are very cold in Kashmir during the winter (30-45 F/0-7 C); Ladakh is one of the coldest inhabited regions on Earth and to be avoided in winter altogether.

Air India , British Airlines and Virgin Atlantic fly to India from the UK, and United Airlines and Delta Airlines from the USA. Air Canada services India from Canada. International airports are at Delhi, Kolkata (Calcutta), Chennai, And Mumbai. Coach, bus and taxis services commute between airport and city; car rentals are available at airports. There are several domestic airlines connecting major cities, including Air India and Indian Air. Druk Air goes between Kolkata and Paro.
Airports in India:There are 333 airports in India.
Travel by Rail:Indian Railways runs the largest rail system in Asia. 12 million passengers are carried daily and the network of rail covers the entire country. Fares are relatively inexpensive. Express trains link the main cities and local services connect the rest of the country. Where the trains dont go the buses pay off the slack. There are many classes of travel so make sure you check the service you want. An Indrail Pass is available for unrestricted travel around India.
There are also some special trains worth looking into with romantic names such as The Palace on Wheels, The Royal Orient Express, The Rajdhani Express and The Konkan Express. These are all luxury trains that either are super fast modern trains, or are indeed palaces on wheels.
Travel by Water:Ferries go from Mumbai, Kolkata (Calcutta), Kochi, Chennai, Calicut, and Panaji (Goa); passenger service from Rameswaram to Sri Lanka is currently suspended. International shipping companies and several cruise lines also serve these ports; no regular passenger liners go to South-East Asia.
Travel by Road:It is essential to have accurate information about border crossings, visa requirements and the political situation if you are travelling into the country by car. Enter India at Sunauli (for Delhi and northwest India), Birganj (for Kolkata and east India) and Kakarbhitta (for Darjeeling). Go from Amritsar into Lahore (Pakistan). If you're determined to travel by car, hire a good driver (take him for a test-drive) and expect to pay his expenses. Motorcycling and bicycling are popular, but the challenges are many. Local transport includes buses, taxis, auto-rickshaws, cycle-rickshaws and tongas (horse-drawn carriages). Arrange your fare in advance.
Adventure holidays include overland tours and buses to India. A bus service now runs between New Delhi and Lahore (Pakistan) four days a week. Private buses are worth the money for long trips. Your bus trips will be interesting enough that, after you've written the book, you'll be able to sell the movie rights.
What Side of the Road?Driving is on the left side of the road.
People and Culture:Language is not the binding factor for Indians, with some speaking Hindi, some various Dravidian languages, and some English-less than popular nowadays. Religion-which means Hinduism for most of the population, is the fabric from which life is woven here. In rural India, one walks back through time for thousands of years, the traditions are so ingrained. Hinduism is famous in the West for its fascinating gods, its belief in reincarnation, and its concept of karma. Buddhism is also practiced by about 6.6 million Indians, with major pilgrimage sites in northern India-Bodhgaya, Sarnath (near Varanasi) and Kushinagar (near Gorakhpur).The Jain religion has about 4.5 million adherents. Mainly in the west and south-west of India. More than 100 million Muslims make India one of the largest Muslim nations on earth, especially influencing the country's architecture, art and food. In the Punjab, the Sikhs number 18 million with their holiest shrine being the Golden Temple in Amritsar. Indian art is much admired but not much understood by the West; it's useful though not necessary to do a bit of reading about religions and art, including architecture, sculpture, dance and music, before travelling there. A stumbling block to appreciation is an entirely different concept of beauty coupled with a far-from-Western aesthetic. Film, mostly melodramas with all the romance that violence, music and love have to offer, is a lively industry, with Bombay the Hollywood of India.
A resident or national of India is called Indian. The Term used to describe things from here is Indian. For example, Indian food.
Tipping and Bargaining:Tipping is practiced here. Bargaining in bazaars and markets is quite acceptable.
* Try to use local currency. Foreign coins cannot be exchanged and will be useless to the person receiving them. Foreign paper money requires a trip to the bank for exchange. However paper US dollars are accepted almost universally.
Food:In such a vast and disparate land, there is no such thing as one Indian cuisine-not curry, not vegetarian, not rice. At least fifteen different cuisines make up the food of India, with vegetarianism, rice dishes and curry-consumption more common in the south, meat-based meals, breads and the influence of Middle-Eastern spices and Central Asian Mughal cooking more commonly found in the north. Generally speaking, the farther south one goes, the hotter the dishes and the more rice one will be served. Thali (TAR-ley), rice and chapattis served with sauces, vegetables and/or meat, is common throughout the country. The tandoor is a clay oven often used for cooking in the north, which produces succulent chicken and other Kashmiri dishes. Kerala is fish served Kashmiri-style with fruit and nuts. You can't avoid (and you won't want to!) samosas (fried vegetables), pakoras (fritters), dal (a porridge-like lentil soup), and the breads-naans and papadums-delicious! An excellent dessert is kheer, or rice pudding.
If you're not offered cutlery, eat with the fingers of your right hand, and avoid street vendors' food unless you watch it being cooked, and dairy products. An exception to this latter is the yoghurt drink called lassi, which is really refreshing, and the very light yoghurt, curd, often served with meals. If your stomach is sensitive, break yourself in with idli, steamed rice cakes, and glucose biscuits. Or go to a Chinese restaurant. Don't drink the water, not even as ice cubes, or foreign soft drinks. You need a liquor license from a tourist office or visa-granting office if you wish to drink liquor in India.
Destination Cities:In the north are Delhi and Kolkata; in the south, Mumbai, Chennai (Madras) and Bangalore, as well as the beaches of Goa. Each region and state differs in culture, customs and history, each having its own ethnic group. Major cities have western hotels and there is a reasonably well developed tourism infrastructure throughout the country.
Points of InterestIn the nineteenth century, British troops and their families holidayed in the hill stations near the Himalayas, with Simla and Darjeeling two favourite destinations-still both popular for their bazaars, tea plantations, Buddhist monasteries and vistas of the magnificent Himalayas. Simla, known as the ""grand dowager of the northern hill towns,"" is where Lord Kitchener of Khartoum had his residence. Darjeeling, to the east, is famous for its miniature train, by which visitors climb from the plains to the city. Agra is the home of the Taj Mahal, truly a ""must-see"" in this country of beauties and wonders. Nearby Fatehpur Sikri, once the capital of the Mughal empire, is a well-preserved 16th-century city. Amritsar is the holy city of the Sikhs.",http://www.buycheapticketstoindia.com/vacationspackagestoindia.jsp
"I'm a big fan of Lois McMaster Bujold and Suzanne Vega. I'd love to know when either artist releases something new. (For those who don't know them, the first is a novelist, and the second is a singer/songwriter.).There are a lot of things I'm interested in, and information about them all can be found somewhere on the Internet.
However, this all seems rather haphazard. So, bands that I like come to town, and I don't hear about it until someone mentions it after they have already left. Or, as happened once before, a friend leaves to work as a roadie for a band I love, and ends up telling me how dreadful they are. (What would you say in that case? 'Gee, I'd love you to sneak me in?').There is a lot of information, and the Internet gives me access to most of it. What I need is something that can look through everything on the Internet, and on the TV News, and in the world's output of Newspapers and magazines, and find the things that I'm interested in.
It would be dull work, so let's not ask our fellow human beings to do it. This calls for a device, one that can handle and sift through vast amounts of data.Sounds like a computer program.
Wouldn't it be great if computers could do all of that: Know what you are interested in, and sift the vast information stream of the Internet and media for the things you want to know?.We could each get a News bulletin about the places and things you care about. Mine would include when Lois McMaster Bujold releases a new novel, either fantasy or SF.
Your News bulletin wouldn't, unless your interests match mine in this case.It would be like having a devoted friend who knows what you like and has all the resources of the BBC and United Press.Maybe, once we start getting personalised News, everyone will start watching the News again.
Now, there is pressure on television News services that says, 'If it bleeds, it leads'. They have to win ratings by reporting brutal murders, instead of the true fact of a steady drop in the murder rate. This makes the world seem scarier than it is, and it is scary enough without that.If computers filtered the News for things people were interested in, maybe reporters and News editors would go back to aiming for interesting topics rather than scary ones.We do have a lot of problems in the world. It'd be helpful to have something that searched the web and the wire services for a solution to each problem.
I mean literally each one. Just cut-and-paste a scary News report into the 'solution' window of this tailored new program, and it filters the substance from the scare mongering and looks for a solution.We might be out of petrol/gasoline in three years. So, how could we survive without petrol to fuel trucks to transport food? How can we grow food without tractors and combine harvesters?.Use of antibiotics, overuse, and misuse are creating antibiotic resistant strains of diseases. How can we stop antibiotic resistant diseases being created? How can we deal with diseases without antibiotics? (A word which means 'against life')?.
When someone creates this solution function for a personalised News program, they might include a function to rephrase scary over-hyped News items as dull fact.

"University of Illinois researchers have developed a way to heal gaps in wires too small for even the world's tiniest soldering iron.
Carbon nanotubes are like tiny hollow wires of carbon just 1 atom thick – similar to graphene but cylindrical. Researchers have been exploring using them as transistors instead of traditional silicon, because carbon nanotubes are easier to transport onto alternate substrates, such as thin sheets of plastic, for low-cost flexible electronics or flat-panel displays.
Carbon nanotubes themselves are high-quality conductors, but creating single tubes suitable to serve as transistors is very difficult. Arrays of nanotubes are much easier to make, but the current has to hop through junctions from one nanotube to the next, slowing it down. In standard electrical wires, such junctions would be soldered, but how could the gaps be bridged on such a small scale?
""It occurred to me that these nanotube junctions will get hot when you pass current through them,"" said Lyding, ""kind of like faulty wiring in a home can create hot spots. In our case, we use these hot spots to trigger a local chemical reaction that deposits metal that nano-solders the junctions.""
Lyding's group teamed with Eric Pop, an adjunct professor of electrical and computer engineering, and John Rogers, Swanlund professor in materials science and engineering, experts on carbon nanotube synthesis and transfer, as well as chemistry professor Greg Girolami. Girolami is an expert in a process that uses gases to deposit metals on a surface, called chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
The nano-soldering process is simple and self-regulating.  When a current passes through the transistor, the junctions heat because of resistance as electrons flow from one nanotube to the next. The molecules react to the heat, depositing the metal at the hot spots and effectively ""soldering"" the junctions. Then the resistance drops, as well as the temperature, so the reaction stops.
The nano-soldering takes only seconds and improves the device performance by an order of magnitude – almost to the level of devices made from single nanotubes, but much easier to manufacture on a large scale.
""It would be easy to insert the CVD process in existing process flows,"" Lyding said. ""CVD technology is commercially available off-the-shelf. People can fabricate these transistors with the ability to turn them on so that this process can be done. Then when it's finished they can finish the wiring and connect them into the circuits. Ultimately it would be a low-cost procedure.""
Now, the group is working to refine the process.
""We think we can make it even better,"" Lyding said. ""This is the prelude, we hope, but it's actually quite significant.""

"Cleveland's first professional sports championship in over 52 years has Karl-Anthony Towns inspired.
The Cavaliers' Game 7 victory over the Golden State Warriors Sunday night was watched by millions of fans throughout the country. But afterwards, the game had sparked a strong response from one of our own Timberwolves' young studs.
Considering it's been 12 years since the Wolves made the playoffs, this should have fans drooling with excitement!
Besides, now that every team's records have reverted back to zero, it's time to start selling hope for the next season. But this time, it feels different here in Minnesota.
For the first time in a LONG time, there's some legit optimism surrounding the Wolves franchise heading into next season. The pieces have slowly been put into place with a good young core of players like Towns, Andrew Wiggins, Zach LaVine and even Ricky Rubio who are all 25-years or younger.
Plus, with new head coach Tom Thibodeau and GM Scott Layden to carry the team into the next phase of development, the Wolves could very well be one of the hottest tickets in the Twin Cities, outside the Vikings, this fall.
Time will tell, of course, on how things will play out this upcoming season, but this Thursday's draft and No. 5 pick (should they choose to keep it) should have a big impact toward shaping the roster into a playoff contending squad.
In any case, seeing the hunger to win from one of the NBA's brightest young stars is good news for Timberwolves' fans. Even if it is only June 20th.",https://1520theticket.com/wolves-towns-wants-what-lebron-has-multiple-nba-titles/

"Roulette Machine is also known as Black Jack and is normally played on a revolving wheel of number, a red board and a black mark, that represent the bets made by the player. The word roulette originated from the French word rouen for wheel. Although it’s commonly associated with card gambling, it’s actually a significant timeless game, originally played in Italy. Today, it’s the most popular casino games on the globe.
If you have ever been interested in “what is a roulette” then you’re certainly not alone.  In fact, if you take just a moment to look at the mechanics of roulette, you’ll quickly note that it’s far more technical than simple gambling! But don’t be discouraged, because even though you don’t know everything there’s to know about roulette, it is possible to still play this fascinating game online!
First of all, it’s important to understand that roulette is really a game of chance. While this may seem obvious, you would be surprised at how many people, including some in the gaming industry, get this to mistake. They believe that because roulette machines are mechanical, they need to have the ability to be programmed in a manner that guarantees certain results. While it’s true that some machines can calculate the probability of a certain outcome, these can’t be used to specifically develop a roulette system that will offer you a set of numbers that you may bet with. So long as you know the ball’s position, what cards are present up for grabs, and what numbers are on your own wheel, you can utilize any software that provides you a couple of rules to generate a variety of possible bets.
However, that’s not all that you can do. There are some tricks of the trade that you can use to not only get better odds with roulette machines, but additionally increase your chances of hitting it big when you do win. For example, it is possible to work with roulette wheels which have larger gaps between their teeth. Because of this when the ball spins round the wheel, you will have more room for you yourself to make a bet, and you may utilize this to either bet longer or bet less.
Roulette enthusiasts know that air-ball roulette machines are made to provide you with the most consistent results. These machines use an interior air compressor that provides the balls extra spin. The secret is that extra spin can give you better odds of hitting the ball. 온라인 바카라 Unfortunately, these roulette wheels have become expensive, making them out of your reach of many smaller players. However, slot machine game roulette wheels are much cheaper, meaning they are readily available to players of most levels of experience.
With both table games, players can choose between paying in “picks” or coins. That’s where players pay real money and place their bets without actually winning anything. Each time they place a bet, the total amount they bet is doubled. The number of times that players can win on these machines is bound, too. For example, in case a player wins once on a single bet, they’ve “lost” the overall game.
With rapid roulette, however, players can win money by playing rapid bets, just like on an air-ball machine. They place their bets, spin the wheel, and, once the ball spins, the bet is doubled. This means that players can gain the benefit of doubling their bets. Rapid roulette is a fantastic way to win more games, so long as players discover how to play it correctly.
You can find three various kinds of roulette, including Texas Hold ’em, European Roulette, and Caribbean Roulette. There are literally a huge selection of variations on each theme, too. You can find so many ways that a person can go about having fun while playing roulette, there is no reason not to play. A person can choose from the regular roulette table or an air-ball machine, choose a theme, select their colors, and more.

"A beneficial girl’s got needs, and often you want to big date and keep one thing casual. Sounds familiar? Then you certainly should become aware of the guidelines out-of casual relationships.
But very first: What is a laid-back dating? Sure, a lot of people understand that everyday dating function you aren’t trying get married the person, exactly what else try inside?
For 1, casual relationship generally means that you are not probably remain someone up to long-identity. The key are ensuring that you are one another on the same webpage each have the same criterion.
Spoiler alert: Yes, there are masters, and never-so-significant relationships are easier to browse than do you believe. These informal relationship info will help.
step 1. Make sure that everybody on it understands the latest score.
You don’t need to generate a large topic from it otherwise actually carry it up the very first time your hang out, however, demonstrably stating something such as, “I like getting together with your, however, I would like to definitely know that I am not saying looking for something really serious right now” may go a long way.
Casual relationships however involves continuing a relationship with anybody, and you will esteem leads to any matchmaking: informal, significant, otherwise someplace in anywhere between. Meaning dealing with the person with the same generosity might treat virtually any individual-simply with no partnership, says Metselaar.
step 3. Carry out everything you really well please.
Staying in a relationship mode just be willing to lose, sign in have a tendency to, and generally spend a solid amount of your energy caring regarding the exactly what your S.O. requires. However with everyday matchmaking, it’s not necessary to carry out some of you to definitely. “You might come and go since you delight with little liability,” states Rosalind Sedacca, a matchmaking and you will relationships mentor, and you will author of 99 One thing Ladies Want to It Realized Prior to Relationship Shortly after 40, 50, & Yes, sixty!.
You could potentially casually date a single people immediately in the event that that’s it you then become like you are capable of, but one of many perks of the entire topic would be the fact you aren’t associated with antique relationships requirements, states psychotherapist Tina B. Tessina, Ph.D., author of How to become one or two whilst still being Feel Totally free.
If however you discover with the social media that your casual day are viewing someone else, just be chill inside, states Metselaar. A similar is true for them with the dating lifetime. And you can, if you begin to see that anybody you might be viewing is getting possessive, shut it off genuine short. There’s absolutely no location for one from inside the informal dating.
six. Do not make future agreements past a short while.
If you prefer people to hang that have towards the Saturday night, it’s entirely okay and work out plans a couple of days during the advance. But any other thing more than that is entering relationship area. “You should extremely reside in the moment, with the knowledge that the moment may be all you have to as they may fulfill anybody they want to time positively,” states Metselaar. Along with, you are able to meet anyone else one which just find them again, and you also don’t want to end up being linked with preparations you suddenly should not keep.
7. Work with other items that you experienced.
Relationships use a lot of rational energy and you may, oh hi, you are not writing about you to definitely today! Play with that opportunity you might features spent on a love and put it on the really works, college, or simply carrying out anything you might be on the. “Casual relationships provides you with a personal, and maybe intimate retailer, without creating need in your some time and thinking,” claims Tessina.
8. Individual likes was a no-go.
nine. Don’t just take them since your and something.
Wedding parties and events try for fulfilling new-people to casually time-maybe not getting anybody you are not purchased to engage together with your family and friends. Wade solo to these situations. “That way your family and friends wouldn’t initiate distinguishing you given that a committed few, as well as your day would not obtain the proven fact that you’re intending to help you incorporate him or her into the family and friends,” says Tessina.
ten. Prevent they for example a grownup.
When you find yourself no further for the some one, actually casually, you can certainly do one of two things: Stop inquiring them to create stuff and hope each goes away (and might), or inform them you are simply not impression they any more when they state they want to spend time. “Honesty is the best rules,” says Tessina. Due to the fact which wasn’t a massive material, it is possible to answer an invite which have a text you to says some thing such as, “I have really preferred spending time with you recently, however, I believe it offers work on its path.” Some thing is preferable to ghosting anybody-that is simply mean.
Extremely, every little thing goes with regards to informal relationship. “Informal relationships has actually couple rules beyond complimentary,” states Tessina. Assuming you just are unable to having a life threatening relationships today, it’s however a good option for you.

Steel Axe possessed initially prepared to evacuate the cities and towns before he dealt with the n.o.bles. As such, he got not interfered with the continual struggles between your Tusk, Expression and Redstone Gates Family members right away. Nonetheless, the immediate physical appearance on the Crimson Mist pressured him to adjust his authentic prepare. As being the Tusk City was the key area that attached the south and north from the kingdom, he had to grab it permit the troops retreating in the Empire of Everwinter by means of.
“Sir, most of the ‘supplies’ s.h.i.+pped from Neverwinter have found the Tusk Metropolis,” a soldier ran approximately the watchtower and documented.
Just a few months ago, this area got still been beneath the judgment in the Tusk Family members, a division of the noble family of the Kingdom of Wolfheart. Steel Axe acquired initially arranged to evacuate the areas and villages before he treated the n.o.bles. Because of this, he acquired not interfered together with the continual fights in between the Tusk, Token and Redstone Gateways People without delay. Nonetheless, the unexpected appearance of the Red-colored Mist compelled him to regulate his unique program. Because the Tusk City was the fundamental community that related the south and north from the empire, he was required to seize it to allow the troops retreating in the Empire of Everwinter through.
Since the Reddish colored Mist extended to distribute, the 1st Army was compelled to constantly getaway out of the Empire of Everwinter to your Kingdom of Wolfheart. Casualties elevated on a daily basis. As being the army was not able to establish a everlasting defensive series, the systems have been often captured unprepared with the adversaries. Knowledge demonstrated that the demons frequently shown up over the pathway that this troops were forced to pa.s.s, irrespective of that they had validated many times beforehand that the road was distinct.
They thus walked out of the fortress and saw a number of hundred steel barrels within a eradicating while watching metropolis entrance. These barrels were actually spherical, about half as taller to be a male, one cubit in size, without using a solo crack on the surface.
There had been nothing else way except combating back again.
Once the demons required the vast majority of locations inside the Empire of Everwinter, that they had superior significantly less quickly. This indicated that since their areas enhanced, the demons found it increasingly difficult to handle the towns and cities they had considered.
The moment the demons required the majority of the cities in the Kingdom of Everwinter, that they had sophisticated significantly more slowly. This indicated that his or her areas enhanced, the demons thought it was increasingly not easy to cope with the locations that they had taken.
To get men’s territories as fast as they could, the demons normally used the Castle-like Monstrous Monster to group of friends out a smallish Red Mist area to permit their troops switch from one vicinity to another one swiftly like frogs, and after that infiltration the area before the Reddish colored Mist completely distributed.
It required enough time to push guys to be effective and take care of encampments. Because the territories widened, the demons’ troops ended up further more spread out. One other important element was that the demons failed to really should give their principal power to infiltration individuals. With ample Reddish Mist, they just needed to dispatch a item to destroy 1 device from the 1st Army. It absolutely was thus totally needless into a.s.semble a big army.
Brian pushed the barrels nevertheless they did not budge in any respect. Seemingly, these barrels were filled up with a thing. n.o.body would like to shell out determination s.h.i.+pping 100s of serious metal barrels towards the leading unless these people were vitally important.
As the Reddish Mist continued to distribute, the very first Army was compelled to constantly retreat coming from the Empire of Everwinter to your Kingdom of Wolfheart. Casualties improved every day. As the army was struggling to build a long term defensive series, the items had been often trapped unprepared with the foes. Learning ability revealed that the demons frequently showed up on the pathway that the troops was required to pa.s.s, inspite of they had confirmed repeatedly beforehand which the highway was distinct.
For a commander who had previously been right after Roland because the very first struggle in Edge Village, Steel Axe believed the army energy of Neverwinter far better than other people. Five years before, that they had still been finding it difficult to defeat the Longsong Duke these days, the First Army could flatten any empire for this country on His Majesty’s purchase.
This was precisely what Iron Axe had followed.
He could see black, crimson clouds distribute along the skies when he gazed upon the north from the watchtower from the castle. The Red Mist obtained already crossed the border in the Empire of Everwinter along with the Kingdom of Wolfheart, and was now urgent slowly toward the Tusk Area.
As being a commander who had previously been using Roland since initial combat in Border Township, Iron Axe recognized the army power of Neverwinter greater than other people. 5yrs back, that they had still been finding it difficult to conquer the Longsong Duke however, the First Army could flatten any empire about this region on His Majesty’s order.
The goal of their military procedure was, in ways, exactly like His Majesty’s, which had been for taking much more inhabited cities and get the gentlemen there provide them. Hence, the demons have been creating every hard work to prevent the initial Army from getting refugees aside.
Nonetheless, this did not give Iron Axe any self-happiness, nor did it unwind his mind.
Right beneath the clouds was Goldwater Village, that had been half enveloped by the Reddish colored Mist. However, amazingly, Steel Axe failed to notice a one Fortress-like Monstrous Monster. Only few Devilbeasts ended up hovering on the sky, like they had been completely abandoned by their friends.
It was exactly what Steel Axe acquired witnessed.
“The demons are applying their safeguard downward,” Brian claimed as he searched via the telescope. He possessed delivered out of the Southernmost Location towards the Sedimentation Bay on Roland’s order with 1,500 Mojin warriors. It was also the initial conventional Fine sand Land army during the good reputation for Graycastle.
It turned out actually pretty clear and understandable why it possessed occured.
Being a commander who had been subsequent Roland considering that the 1st battle in Edge Community, Iron Axe knew the military services sturdiness of Neverwinter superior to others. Five years ago, they had still been fighting to conquer the Longsong Duke however, the primary Army could flatten any empire on this particular country on His Majesty’s get.
“Sir, exactly what are they?” Brian required because he researched the barrels all around, looking utterly puzzled. They did not appear to be typical storage containers since there had been no deals with. They did not resemble weaponry possibly. Many fights had advised him that repaired explosives were far less powerful than cannons. It had been a tad too unrealistic to implement these barrels to combat the demons off.
He comprehended the unbridgeable gap between the man race plus the demons.
Being the Reddish colored Mist carried on to spread, the very first Army was required to constantly retreat from the Empire of Everwinter on the Empire of Wolfheart. Casualties elevated everyday. Since the army was incapable of establish a long-lasting defensive series, the items had been often stuck unprepared via the opponents.

"Manufacturing printing plates is a complex process, where defects can sneak in at the various production steps. Imperfect printing plates cause printed material of inferior quality. Since quality requirements in many areas are high and continue to rise, the consequential costs of these defects are high.
Algoscan and Impuls have cooperated and developped a fully automatic inspection system for printing plates. Algoscan is specialized on surface inspection and Impuls has contributed the computer vision know-how. The printing plate is scanned on a highly precise moving table with a high-resolution camera and compared with a digital master. The measurement accuracy is 5 µm with a printing plate of a size of 100 x 110 cm. The inspection system can classify various defect types.

"Arsenal are “considering a January move for Orlando City star Facundo Torres” after the Gunners were “warned of the Uruguayan striker by their South American scout who first spotted Neymar”.
Arsenal are considering a move for Facundo Torres, according to a report.
Manager Mikel Arteta, whose side currently lead the Premier League by two points, is looking to add more depth to his squad as he aims to continue his title run this season, and wants to add a right-back to his ranks to to the competition by Bukayo Saka.
According to the Standard, the Gunners are ready to hold talks with the Uruguayan and his agents after the 22-year-old impressed in the 2022 MLS season for Orlando City.
Torres scored nine goals and made 10 assists in his debut year at the club after joining Penarol on a four-year deal in January for around £7.75m.
It is currently unclear whether Arsenal will go ahead with the move after initial talks, but negotiations will begin soon.
While Arsenal added depth in several areas of the pitch over the summer, the club are keen to add more wide players to their ranks, with Reiss Nelson replacing Saka against Nottingham Forest on Sunday when the English was injured.
Nelson scored twice in the game, but it was his first appearance of the season and it is unclear whether he is in Arteta’s long-term plans.
Although Torres played and scored against Arsenal in pre-season, Toni Lima, a scout at the club appointed in 2021, is believed to have sparked interest from north London after identifying the winger.
Lima specializes in South American talent and is credited with being one of the first to spot Neymar and Philippe Coutinho during their playing days in Brazil.
Arsenal have also been linked with Wolves’ Pedro Neto and Shakhtar Donetsk’s Mykhaylo Mudryk, but Torres is believed to be at the top of their target list, with a full-back looking increasingly likely to arrive in January.

In front of the main hall, his heart was does gallbladder disease cause weight loss truly relieved.

"""Trust the experts"" gets filed under ""Ignorance is strength"". Consider: In the statement ""the solution isn't to try to think more carefully"", the adverb phrase ""more carefully"" is an entirely meaningless qualifier. After all, if thinking ""more carefully"" is not the solution, then thinking less carefully can hardly be the solution, either. And if thinking neither ""more carefully"" nor ""less carefully"" can be the solution, then it follows that thinking ""at all"" can not the solution.

Up to 4 people, including Alec Baldwin, might end up facing charges in ""Rust"" shooting https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-district-attorney-says-up-to-four-people-could-get-charged-homicide/ Caitlin O'Kane (26 September 2022) A district attorney in New Mexico said she could be close to charging up to four people, including actor Alec Baldwin, in the ""Rust"" film set shooting that occurred in Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. During the shooting, Baldwin's prop gun was discharged, killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. First Judicial District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies made an emergency funding request for $635,500 to continue to fund the investigation of the high-profile case. ""We are within weeks, if not days, of receiving the final report from the sheriff's office,"" Carmack-Altwies said during a New Mexico Board of Finance meeting on Sept. 20. She said while they are still awaiting reports ""it's become apparent that we will be potentially charging between one and four people with criminal charges and each of those charges will probably include some variation of our homicide statute.""
It is typical of those with a victimization mentality that they (or their team) must always be the biggest victims. Any claims of victimization by others must always be downplayed as being of lesser significance (or denigrated as being of no importance). The problem isn't necessarily that those who indulge a victimization mentality have not been victimized. They might have been. The problem is that they are motivated more by narcissism than by justice. Narcissism values the wrongs done to oneself (or to one's team), and disvalues the wrongs done to others.

 *   TEST COVERAGE NOTES
 *
 *   The following notes describe the purpose of the test cases in
 *   order to ensure full coverage of all return paths in the code to
 *   be tested, as well as test for security concerns in the target.
 *   The test methodology is to perfrom branch-coverage testing to ensure
 *   all exit paths from the code have been tested. Additional tests are added to
 *   perform some corner case validation of certain more complex branches
 *   to verify no side-effects or missing corners are introduced in the code.
 *
 *   BASIC PARAMETER VALIDATION
 *   TC 1: Test for first parameter, destination char string, being sent in as NULL
 *   TC 2: Test for third parameter, dest maximum length (dmax), being sent in as zero
 *   TC 3: Test for third parameter, dest maximum length (dmax), being larger than the maximum allowed size
 *
 *   TC 4: Test setting a single character
 *   TC 5: Test setting two characters
 *   TC 6: Test setting multiple characters (12)
 *   TC 7: Test setting multiple characters (31)
 *   TC 8: Test setting multiple characters (133)

"Sundew a first for me on a day my friend saw her first Green Hairstreak butterfly.
If anyone is offended by the image of an insect eating plant, my apologies and I will take it down if requested.
How could anyone be offended by such an attractive little plant - lions and tigers appear here now and again!
Wow, great looking plant.
Fabulous details. What nice focusing.
@fbailey Lions & Tigers, no problem, but anything with its prey could be unpleasant for many (self included!).
@joev @milaniet @susie1205 Thank you all so much. This was a wonderful first for me and now I know where they are and what to look for I hope to see them next month when I go looking for England's rarest moth.
Do you know what this plant is? As I took a macro shot of this plant two weeks ago on 2 June. Does like like a fly trap but I didn't see any mouths? Did yours have mouths?
@koalagardens You are so correct, the great outdoors, even if it's only your own tiny garden, is a wonderful place to be.
@rubysandals I'm putting up another shot of the Sundew so you can see the captured insects more clearly. I'll take it down when you've seen it as I don't care to display anything dead if possible.
Super little plant, nature so clever! Awesome capture!
@bigmxx I'd never seen them before, I knew they were at Strensall Common but I tend to look for butterflies & moths there.
They are very tiny, low lying too, easy to miss.
Great find Jesika, I think they dissolve the prey and absorb the resulting soup. I have seen them before, I know a site where they are ( or at least were) not that far from me.
@markp I'd love to claim credit, but my friend was searching for them as I was looking for Green Hairstreak. 2 Labradogs stopped us beside the drying pond where the plants were growing. The dogs get the credit.
Thanks for the information, I thought it was something like that.
Well, this is simply a stunning plant! Never heard of it before either. I don't even see the butterfly but maybe my brain doesn't want to see that part. I see an amazing colorful and sparkly plant! FAVorite!
@gardenfolk Thank you. The Sundew didn't capture a butterfly, so no need to worry about that. It's a different matter for flies though. I'd put up a second photo which had captured prey showing but took it down because I'm unhappy about dead anythings unless it was a natural death and I can use it for ultra close up work.
I'd never seen them before but my friend is a botantist so was searching for them.
@jesika2 Well, flies are mostly pests, aren't they? It might be interesting to see that since I dislike them in my house or landing on my food! I am a lover of animals, birds and wildlife so would not want to see anything happen to them! I have not eaten meat since 1992!",http://365project.org/jesika2/365/2018-06-07

"(Yid., Rayshe, Reyshe), city in southeastern Poland. Founded in 1354, Rzeszów was a privately owned town until 1845. The first mention of Jews residing there dates from 1550. Rzeszów’s owners supported Jewish settlement, and by 1592, six Jews owned houses. Local Jews made their livings as traders and artisans. In 1648 the town’s Jewish population had risen to approximately 680, augmented by Jews fleeing westward from the Cossack uprising led by Bohdan Khmel’nyts’kyi. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, 412 of the 473 merchants in Rzeszów were Jewish. By 1765, the number of Jews in the town had risen to about 1,200.
In the early seventeenth century, Jews built a brick synagogue on a street that became known as Jewish Street; nearby was the Jewish cemetery. A second synagogue, known as the Nowomiejska (New City) synagogue, was built in the early 1700s, and a second cemetery was established in the mid-nineteenth century. Jews as well as Christians shared an obligation to defend the city. After a dispute with the community in Przemyśl over a rabbinical appointment, Rzeszów seceded from the “land” of Ruthenia and, from about 1715, was represented as an independent entity in the Council of Four Lands. In 1730, the city’s owner, Jerzy Ignacy Lubomirski, charged them with the defense of four of the eight city gates.
In 1772, with the first partition of Poland, Rzeszów fell under Austrian rule, and a number of restrictions were placed upon the city’s Jews. Despite these difficulties, Rzeszów’s Jewish residents continued to dominate retail trade. During most of the nineteenth century, Jews made up the majority of the town’s inhabitants: in 1816, they numbered 3,575, or 77.6 percent; in 1880, they totaled 5,820, or 52.1 percent; in 1900, there were 6,320, or 42.1 percent; and in 1910, the numbers reached 8,785, or 37.1 percent.
From the end of the nineteenth century a number of Jewish political parties, most of them Zionist, became active in Rzeszów, and the Zionist movement markedly increased in strength after World War I. On 3 May 1919, anti-Jewish violence broke out, with beatings, lootings, and destruction of property. In 1922, Rabbi Aharon Lewin (1879–1941) was elected as a deputy to the Polish Sejm, representing the Orthodox Agudas Yisroel party. In 1921, the city was home to 11,361 Jews, who made up 45.5 percent of its population. In 1928 a donation from Adolf Tannenbaum allowed for the building of a “People’s House,” which beginning in 1931 housed a private Jewish secondary school. In the 1934 municipal elections, Jews won 15 of 35 seats on the city council.
At the outbreak of World War II, more than 13,000 Jews were living in Rzeszów. After 1939, the population grew, augmented by Jews forcibly resettled out of Polish territories annexed to the German Reich. In December 1941, the Germans created a ghetto, crowding more than 23,000 persons within its confines. The first significant deportation from Rzeszów occurred between 7 and 13 July 1942, when the Germans sent the elderly and the sick—a total of about 2,000 Jews—to the Bór forest near Głogów Małopolski, where they were shot to death; another 14,000 were sent to Bełżec. Subsequent deportations were carried out on 8 August and 15 November of that year. In November 1942, the Rzeszów ghetto was turned into a “secondary” ghetto for Jews from the already liquidated ghettos of Krosno, Jasło, and Sanok. It was then divided into two parts: Ost (East) for those able to work, and West for all others. In September 1943, the inhabitants of the former were deported to a camp in Szebiny, where most were murdered; the West ghetto was liquidated that November, its inhabitants ending up in Auschwitz. The few dozen Jews who had been left in Rzeszów to clean up the ghetto were deported in February 1944.
On 9 September 1944, about 300 Jewish survivors formed a new community, whose numbers diminished after antisemitic attitudes erupted into violence on 12 June 1945. In 1947, the remaining Jews of Rzeszów erected a memorial to victims of the Holocaust in the new Jewish cemetery.

Francis Tregian the younger as music copyist
A legend?
DAVID J. SMITH responds to a controversial recent
article which reconsiders the provenance of an important
collection of 16th/17th-century English manuscripts

IN A RECENT article, Ruby Reid Thompson dismisses the established view of the Tregian manuscripts (FVB, Eg.3665, Dr.4302, and Ch.Ch.510-14) as legend, questioning the assumptions that have come to surround our understanding of them.1 It is always worthwhile to re-examine evidence relating to any musical source to see what basis there is for forming an opinion about its provenance. However, there is a danger of replacing one 'legend' with another. Thompson puts forward the view that these great anthologies were compiled by more than one scribe in a scriptorium in which there was a conscious effort to preserve as uniform a style of writing as possible, and that the type of paper used suggests a court connection. However, the evidence for this is as circumstantial as that used in the identification of the younger Francis Tregian as the scribe. In this article I shall challenge her interpretation of the physical characteristics of the Tregian manuscripts and argue for a reinstatement of the Tregian hypothesis.2
There is no direct evidence naming the scribe of any of these sources. The names which appear on the covers and flyleaves of FVB, Eg.3665, Dr.4302, and Ch.Ch.510-14 are later additions, providing no clue as to the original owner. There is no record of the compilation of these anthologies: nowhere is there a reference to any individual or group copying music on this scale. This means that any explanation of these manuscripts remains hypothetical. It is not so much a question of determining the validity of the Tregian 'legend', but of ascertaining whether a working hypothesis identifying him as the scribe may be held to critical account. Scholars and editors have tended, perhaps wrongly, to imply a greater degree of certainty over the penmanship than they would probably have intimated had they been questioned more closely about the subject. In the same way that scientists tend to speak of the latest hypothesis as if it were established fact, so have musicologists and performers described the Tregian manuscripts in the absence of a fuller explanation of how they came to be. The hypothesis - not legend - that Tregian wrote the manuscripts may be discarded if some material fact comes to light which proves that he cannot have been the scribe, or if an alternative view seems better fitted to what can be gleaned from the manuscripts themselves and other evidence. Does Thompson's alternative view offer a better explanation than the working hypothesis? Should her 'legend' replace the existing one?
Thompson's hypothesis is founded upon an exhaustive and detailed examination of the physical attributes of the manuscripts, including handwriting. She rejects Cole's identification of Tregian as scribe,3 giving a number of examples purporting to show not only that Tregian's handwriting does not match that of the manuscripts, but also that the scripts within the collection vary. Thompson also casts doubt on whether the document reproduced in her Plate I (fig. 1 in this article) is in Tregian's hand (other than his signature).4 Although some of Cole's conclusions regarding FVB turn out to be unsubstantiated by later research,5 those regarding Tregian as scribe of the manuscript should not be readily dismissed.
IT is important to distinguish between the evolution of a script over time, variations within a script caused by differences in ink and pen, and the deliberate adoption of different scripts by the same scribe. There was a high degree of variation within scripts produced by the same person in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and educated men frequently cultivated more than one style of handwriting, in the same way as we today use more than one typeface in a word-processed document.6 Jonathan Wainwright has demonstrated considerable variation in the music script employed by Stephen Bing, and points out that he cultivated two distinct text-hands in the manuscripts copied by him.7 A person's signature usually differs from their handwriting, but signatures can also vary according to context: William Byrd's signatures vary considerably from document to document.8
Although it is by no means clear that the person who wrote the document in Thompson's Plate III was the same as the scribe of the document in Plate I (figs. 1 and 2),9 we should not rule it out. Even the signatures do not look as though they belong to the same person (exx. 1 and 2). In fact the upper case 'T' of the signature in Plate III matches very closely the letter-form found in the main script of Plate I, and resembles the formation of the letter in FVB (exx.3, 4 and 5). Perhaps it is significant that the example taken from Plate I is from the name `Thomas Tregian'. It is possible that Francis Tregian wrote the first document as well as signing it; even if he did not, the scribe was probably someone close to the family, if not a member. If it is possible to associate any script present in Plates I and III with scripts occurring in the Tregian manuscripts, then there is no reason to discard the hypothesis on ground of handwriting alone.",https://web.archive.org/web/20080124161522/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3870/is_200207/ai_n9139095/pg_1

"Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, commander of Germany’s Wehrmacht, signed the surrender agreement with Allied forces on 7th May, 1945. The agreement declared that all Nazi troops of Germany’s land, air and naval forces should put down their arms and stop fighting.
Most of Germany’s troops obeyed, but a few regiments continued to fight until their last man, including thousands of German troops stuck in the Soviet area of Poland. These soldiers continued to fire on Soviet troops in the coastal city of Danzig, and what was left of the German 4th Army fought on at Heiligenbeil, East Prussia. A few pockets of German troops on the Greek Islands also continued to wage war until the following day.
Five days after the surrender had been agreed upon, the Wehrmacht and SS troops in Czechoslovakia continued to fight, as did troops in Poland’s Hel Peninsula. The final German troops surrendered their weapons on 13th and 14th May.
Six days after the surrender 30,000 pro-Nazi troops from Germany and other Eastern European countries fought a battle against Communist fighters on the Yugoslavian and Austrian border. The battle lasted for two days and more than 400 were killed. The Allies intervened and sent thousands of Yugoslavian civilian back home; upon their return were killed by the new national army.
At sea, the German U-boat U-234 didn’t surrender until 14th May. The submarine was in the mid-North Atlantic when Germany officially surrendered, and didn’t receive the order until the 10th May. Even then its Captain, Johann-Heinrich Fehler, decided to head to the US instead of returning to Europe; there he believed they would receive a less lengthy detention than from British or Allied forces in Europe, Military History Now reports.
U-234 was captured by the USS Sutton not far from Newfoundland. The submarine also held two Japanese passengers and stocks of uranium that Hitler was sending to Nazi sympathisers in the Far East. The Japanese passengers decided to commit suicide rather than serve time as POWs. The submarine was taken to the The Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard, Maine where its uranium was confiscated and possibly used to add to US nuclear power stocks. The crewmen were all repatriated and the submarine was eventually destroyed just off Cape Cod.
Editors note: It turns out that there were German units that surrendered well after May 14th 1945.",https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/last-of-the-german-troops-to-surrender-may-13th-1945.html

Kimbo Slice and the Biggest Flameouts in MMA History
Every now and again a special talent comes along in MMA. Sometimes it's a NCAA National Champion Wrestler. Sometimes it's a journeyman finally getting his chance to shine after years of toiling in obscurity. Sometimes he comes from our own backyard. Sometimes he comes from halfway around the globe. Sometimes he displays remarkable heart and fortitude. Sometimes he exhibits unparalleled skill and ability.
Regardless of nationality, skill set or story, some fighters capture our attention and demand our respect and admiration. These are the fighters that carve out names for themselves among the pantheon of combat sports' greatest warriors.
And then there are those fighters that come along and convince the world that they are destined for such greatness, only to crash and burn in spectacular fashion.
This article is dedicated to the latter group—those who began their MMA career with exceptional hype and fanfare, those who shocked the world once, but could never reach that level again, and those who made us scratch our heads and wonder why we ever accepted them as legitimate mixed martial artists in the first place.
They shall be honored here.
9: Nick Diaz
Nick Diaz makes the list, not because he lacks any sort of talent, but because of his continued exhibitions of mental immaturity.
Diaz has had a lengthy career consisting of 34 professional fights, which began in 2001. He is a former Strikeforce champion, and UFC veteran. In spite of such impressive accolades, Diaz could justifiably be considered a disappointment.
If he sticks to his guns and retires as he claimed he intended to do in the aftermath of his decision loss to Carlos Condit on February 4, Diaz will be exiting the sport at the peak of his talent and notoriety. Before facing Condit, Diaz was on an 11-fight win streak, and was considered a top 5 welterweight by many fans and analysts.
The road to immortality is a very long and arduous one, but it seems the other side of the hill is much steeper.
If Diaz is indeed finished with MMA, he leaves behind a legacy of unfulfilled promise, failed drug tests and one of the most sudden exoduses that MMA has ever seen by a popular fighter.
If, however, Diaz serves his drug suspension and gets back into the cage to fight once again, he will receive a full pardon from the disappointment label.
Let's hope the latter scenario plays out.
8: Brock Lesnar
Lesnar walks a fine line between being a success story, and a disappointment.
On one hand, it is pretty sensational that a fighter who debuted in MMA a few days before his 30th birthday, held the UFC Heavyweight title only months after his 31st.
On the other hand, it is a pretty long fall from being the ""Baddest Man on the Planet"" to a whipping post for legitimate heavyweights.
After suffering from a series of medical ailments that sidelined the former champ for large parts of 2009 and 2011, Lesnar succumbed to both Cain Velasquez and Alistair Overeem via first-round knockout.
Though he was able to lay claim to some significant accomplishments during his short tenure as a UFC fighter, Lesnar will be remembered for his flamboyance, one dimensional style and abrupt departure from the sport after it simply became too hard for him to win against top fighters.
7: Houston Alexander
Remember when Joe Rogan screamed, ""Ladies and gentlemen, Houston Alexander is for real!"" after he obliterated Alessio Sakara in one minute? Do you?
It turns out he actually wasn't as for real as Joe thought.
Alexander debuted by stomping a highly regarded, Keith Jardine, who was fresh off an upset win over Forrest Griffin, and followed it up by violently slaying Sakara.
His strength seamed unreal. He walked through punches like the Terminator. He looked every bit the part of his moniker—""The Assassin."" Heck, the guy even trained in his own basement!
What more could we want in a prospect?
Longevity maybe?
After dismantling two UFC light heavyweights, Alexander was brought down to earth, suffering three straight first round defeats. Upon strike three, he was handed his UFC pink slip.
After his release from the UFC, Alexander put a victory under his cap in the AMMA organization, before being recalled by Dana White to fight against Kevin ""Kimbo Slice"" Ferguson.
The two were supposed to stand toe-to-toe and swing, but Alexander thought it would be wise to employ some Floyd Mayweatheresque boxing, which of course, he was fresh out of. He lost a one-sided decision and was released from the UFC for a second time.
Since his latest release, Alexander has amassed a 4-2 record, with a win coming over Sokoudjou.
6: Satoshi Ishii
Like Diaz, Ishii still has time to turn it around. He is only 25 years of age, and has but six MMA fights to his name.
Ishii is a former Olympic Judo gold medalist who infamously signed on with the UFC before having a single pro fight to his name, only to renege on the deal in favor of fighting in his native Japan.
The heavyweight debuted on New Year's Eve, 2009, in a losing effort against Hidehiko Yoshida, a fighter who had only obtained a single win in the three years prior to his showdown with Ishii.
Since that time, Ishii has defeated Tafa Misipati, who owned an 0-1 record before the fight, and who retired after the fight. He has also beat Japanese legend, Ikuhisa ""Minowaman"" Minowa, who fights at middleweight. His third victory came against 4-9 Katsuyori Shibata.
The crowing jewel of Ishii's career is a victory over the only heavyweight he has ever defeated, French kickboxer, Jerome Le Banner, who was 3-1 at the time he was defeated by Ishii.
Ishii's two most recent matches came in 2011—a draw with out of shape, former middleweight, Paulo Filho, and a knock out loss on New Year's Eve, at the hand of a past-his-prime, Fedor Emelianenko.
In 2009 Ishii was considered the potential savior of Japanese MMA. In 2012, not so much.
5: Rameau Thierry Sokoudjou
Sokoudjou knocked out highly regarded light heavyweight fighter, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, in the first round, of his first fight in the Pride FC organization (his third career fight). When people questioned whether Sokoudjou was a one-hit-wonder, the ""African Assassin"" put their minds at ease by knocking out jiu-jitsu ace, Ricardo Arona, in the first round of his encore performance.
At that point, the Sokoudjou hype was paramount.
To the excitement of nearly every MMA fan on the planet, ZUFFA's purchase of Pride FC ensured the top prospect would debut stateside in the world's largest organization, the UFC.
That is when things went downhill.
Sokoudjou's hype train was derailed by karate specialist, Lyoto Machida, during his inaugural UFC match. Two fights later, Sokoudjou was bounced from the company after suffering a loss to Luiz Cane.
Since then, Sokoudjou has compiled a 7-7 record in various organizations in the United States and Japan.
Few fighters have entered the UFC with as much hype as the Cameroonian, and even fewer that have, have stayed so briefly.
4: Bob Sapp
As a former professional football player, and K-1 Hiroshima Grand Prix kickboxing champ, Bob Sapp's move into MMA was met with much intrigue.
The aptly named ""Beast"" saw his celebrity grow in the land of the rising sun, as he delighted the Japanese crowd with his monstrous physic, extreme aggression and initial successes in MMA.
Sapp's first loss came via armbar to Minotauro Nogueira, in only the Beast's third pro contest. After demolishing the Brazilian for the better part of nine minutes, the submission master got the better of the MMA newbie. This was written off as lack of experience, and Sapp seemed to learn from the fight, winning his next two contests by first round submission.
The next several years saw Sapp put together a solid 10-3 record, marred only by forays into K-1, such as that against Mirko Cro Cop. The beating he received from the Croatian legend blew away a lot of the mystique Sapp veiled himself in, and it didn't help that the loss came less than a year after his first defeat by Minotauro.
Since 2009 Sapp has maintained a dubious 1-7 record, suffering seven first round defeats.
At the outset of his career, Sapp looked promising; he was considered a good striker, he would hold a size advantage over pretty much any potential opponent and possessed freakish athleticism.
At current, Sapp is a sideshow; he is an easy victory for any fighter who wants one, and a spectacle rather than an athlete.
He doesn't seem to mind.
3: James Toney
James Toney did not exactly garner particularly high expectations from many people when he decided to try his hand at mixed martial arts back in 2010, as a 42-year-old. Even so, his one and only match, the one against Randy Couture, received as much attention as nearly any other fight in MMA history.
As most of the world predicted, the fight was a rather pathetic display of a former top boxer grasping at the spotlight leaking between his fingers.
Couture more or less fell forward in the general direction Toney was standing, and secured a takedown before getting the pugilist's back and tapping him out.
All told, Toney spent three minutes and 19 seconds as a professional mixed martial artist. Though brief, it was far too long.
2: Kevin ""Kimbo Slice"" Ferguson
After establishing himself as a street-fighting Youtube sensation, Kimbo Slice set the world on fire when he began his career as a mixed martial artist.
Ok, maybe he didn't exactly set the world on fire.
But, he did beat up two guys, including a 42-year-old, Tank Abbott, before winning a curious stoppage against heavyweight washout James Thompson.
And, according to then president of the recently revived EliteXC promotion, Gary Shaw, that was enough to make Slice a legend.
As bizarre as it sounds, Shaw actually was able to convince one man of Kimbo's greatness, Gus Johnson, who dubbed Seth Petruzelli's first round knockout of Slice ""The biggest upset in MMA history!""
After EliteXC folded, Slice gave The Ultimate Fighter a shot, but was eliminated by Roy Nelson. He was subsequently given a chance to fight on the show's finale, where he defeated Houston Alexander.
His second fight in the UFC was his last, a TKO loss to Matt Mitrione.
Kimbo's garnering of consideration as a plausible mixed martial artist was a bit of a running joke among MMA purists. Very few with much knowledge of the sport considered him anything but a sideshow. He was, more than anything, a victim of the hype created for him by someone trying to make a buck off his name.
In a twist of poetic justice, Kimbo ended up doing quite well for himself financially in MMA, before beginning a boxing career, while Gary Shaw, the man responsible for infecting the world with Kimbo-fever, ran his promotion into the ground by hitching his wagon to Kimbo's star.
1: Lee Murray
Back in 2004, ""Lightning"" Lee Murray was a rising star in MMA.
In 2006, he masterminded the largest cash robbery in British history.
Many fighters start out their career hot, but few end it so spectacularly as Murray, who was sentenced to a minimum of 25 years (originally only 10) in Moroccan prison.
If you can't wait for the movie about Murray's MMA career/robbery (there is one in planning), you may read up a bit on it here.
Once in prison, Murray attempted an unsuccessful escape. Though unable to secure his freedom, he has supposedly fathered a child while behind bars.
Murray came from a troubled past, but found a great deal of success in MMA. He compiled an 8-2 record as a pro, losing only to submission specialist, Joe Doerkson, and current UFC middleweight kingpin, Anderson Silva.
One match that isn't on his official record is an alleged bar fight with then UFC champ, Tito Ortiz. Matt Hughes has corroborated Murray's version of the story that says he knocked out the ""Huntington Beach Bad Boy"" in a back alley behind a watering hole.
Murray was 1-0 in the UFC, but Visa issues stemming from his criminal record in the UK prevented him from working in the States.
There are rumors circulating, which indicate Murray may secure a release from prison before serving out his full sentence due to newly executed analysis of forensic evidence.
Though just a rumor, one cannot help but wonder whether or not a release would see the Brit get back into the cage.
A scary thought. For many reasons.",http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1064754-kimbo-slice-and-the-biggest-flameouts-in-mma-history/page/9
"“Kimbo Slice” has found a new home.
Sources close to the situation have advised Combat Press that Kevin “Kimbo Slice” Ferguson will join the Bellator roster, with an announcement expected to take place during the Bellator 132 telecast on Jan. 16.
Ferguson, who shot to fame through a series of street-fight videos that were posted on the internet, made his MMA debut under the EliteXC banner in 2007. The promotion went all in on Ferguson as the face of the company, and it paid off at first with Ferguson reeling off three straight wins. However, it all came crumbling down when Ferguson fought Seth Petruzelli in 2008. Petruzelli knocked out Ferguson in 14 seconds, shattering the fighter’s aura of invincibility.
After appearing on The Ultimate Fighter: Heavyweights in 2009 and suffering a TUF exhibition loss to Roy Nelson, Ferguson went 1-1 in the UFC, notching a victory over Houston Alexander and then later suffering a loss at the hands of Matt Mitrione.
Following his departure from the UFC, Ferguson undertook a career in boxing which saw him win seven fights in a row and maintain an undefeated record. Bellator reportedly pursued Ferguson in 2014, but the two sides were not able to reach a deal at that time.
An official date and opponent have yet to be determined for Ferguson’s Bellator debut, but a match-up is expected to be confirmed in the coming days.
Bellator has made waves with some of its recent moves, including the signing of Stephan Bonnar and the pairing of Bonnar with Tito Ortiz to headline Bellator 131 in November. Bellator has also come up in recent rumors surrounding pro-wrestling superstar Brock Lesnar.",http://combatpress.com/2015/01/bellator-mma-adds-kevin-kimbo-slice-ferguson-to-roster/

"Punk possibly unable to compete?
CLEVELAND -- After a calculated group attack by Randy Orton and a gang of multi-generation Superstars, World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk may be unable to compete tonight at Unforgiven. If necessary, Raw General Manager Mike Adamle has vowed to find a suitable replacement for Punk in the World Heavyweight Championship Scramble which will still take place, live tonight. Exclusive photos...
Just moments after watching both SmackDown and ECW's Championship Scrambles and mere minutes before his own title defense, the Straightedge Superstar was confronted by Orton in the locker room area. The Legend Killer's verbal exchange distracted Punk long enough for World Tag Team Champions Ted DiBiase & Cody Rhodes and newfound associate Manu (son of Wild Samoan Afa) to blindside the tattooed champion.
Coming to CM Punk's aid was Kofi Kingston, though even the Jamaican Craze could not overcome the combined force of four dangerous competitors. Then, Orton's notoriously lethal punt to Punk's head put the champion out of commission, making him potentially incapable of defending the gold that he's worked tirelessly to uphold since July.
This well conspired plot -- seemingly devised by the embittered, recuperating Legend Killer -- has possibly guaranteed a new World Heavyweight Champion tonight on pay-per-view.
Will Punk be cleared to compete? If not, who would Adamle select to fill the fifth and final spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Scramble? Stay logged on to WWE.com for live updates, exclusive interviews and much more Unforgiven coverage.

WWE RAW
October 5, 2009
Wilkes-Barre, PA
Commentators: Michael Cole & Jerry “The King” Lawler
Report by: Hunter Golden of WrestleView.com
Pittsburgh Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger comes out to the ramp and fluffs up the Wilkes-Barre crowd. He said they have a big night ahead of them and that they wouldn’t waste any time getting things going. He announced the first diva bowl.
Diva Bowl
A brawl broke out to start before Layla flopped for the heck of it. No, seriously, it was probably the best thing about the match. Mickie took turns turning and burning on the heels before everyone began diving in the ring and doing Jersey All Pro set spots. Mickie hit her finisher and then rolled up Alicia.
Winners: The Baby face Divas via pin fall
WWE Champion Randy Orton’s music hit and he came out to the ring as we went to commercial.
****Commercial****
Orton was in the ring and put his win over from the Hell in a Cell pay per view last night. He said he proved he didn’t need anyone to follow through on his word. He said John Cena might as well not bother waiting around, and he could come out and request his rematch.
Sure enough, Cena came out to the ring. He congratulated Orton on his win and put over what their rivalry had become. He said he did intend to use his rematch clause, but wanted their last match to be a special one. He suggested that at Bragging Rights, they have an Iron Man Match. Orton told him ‘not so fast’. He said if there was any rematch, it’d be on his terms. He said there’d be an iron man match but it’d be no dq, no count-out. He said if Cena lost, he’d be off Raw. Cena shook hands and agreed to the match.

Jack Swagger vs. Primo Colon
Swagger grabbed a front face lock before easily tossing Primo across the ring. Primo countered with a hurricanranna only for Swagger to cut him off with an elbow and Irish whip him hard to the buckles. Swagger hit a Vader bomb before heading to the outside and landing some clubbing blows across the chest of Primo.
Swagger hammered away on Primo’s back before connecting with a belly to belly throw for a two count. Swagger slapped on a bear hug before moving Primo to the corner. He hit a shoulder thrust, only for Primo to duck the third and attempt a sunset flip for a two count. Swagger kicked out and powered Primo to the corner to hit some more big right hands.
Primo fought back briefly and then hit a drop kick for a one count. Primo looked for a springboard cross body block, but Swagger connected with a huge boot to the ribs. Swagger scooped up Primo and hit a big doctor bomb and that’s all she wrote.
Winner: Jack Swagger via pin fall
Big Show and Chris Jericho are in the back. We’ll hear from them soon.
****Commercial****
Santino tried to get the divas to ‘kiss and make up’. It didn’t work.
The Miz walked in on Ben Roethlisberger. He wants a shot against Kofi Kingston tonight. His backhanded comments don’t help him out too much. Finally, Ben gives him the match on one condition: that he gets on the mic if he loses and says; “I’m the Miz and I’m awful”. Miz reluctantly agrees.
****Commercial****
MVP & Mark Henry vs. Chris Masters & Chavo Guererro
Henry and Masters started off doing some power spots. Henry hit a big shoulder block and a big splash, but looked like he did something to his knee. MVP tagged in and covered for him before eventually getting overwhelmed by the odds.
MVP fought back with some lariats before leap frogging Chavo and hitting him with a shoulder block. He geared up for Ballin’ and gave the crowd what they wanted. Masters tried to break up the pin fall, only to elbow his partner when MVP dodged him.

They have some back and forth before the linemen line up opposite Show and Jericho, who take off through the ropes. DX’s music hit and they come out. After some more verbal jousting, DX challenges Jericho and Show to a match for their belts. Jericho says the two aren’t worth the match before Ben cuts them off and says they’ll face each other tonight.

United States Championship
Kofi Kingston vs. The Miz
The two locked up before breaking in the ropes. Miz charged Kofi and ended up on the outside before Miz darted back into the ring. Miz head butted Kofi in the face before laying the boots to him on the mat and choking him out on the ropes.
Kofi looked for a spin kick but hit a double thrust and a roll up for a two count. Miz bailed to the outside for a breather before heading back in regrouped. Kofi grabbed go behind and a roll up for another one count. Miz quickly counted out and read a leap frog well and connected with a big lariat for a quickie cover attempt.
Miz choked Kofi on the mat before slamming him into the turn buckle. Miz charged Kofi and missed, only for Kofi to hit a flurry of punches in the corner. Kofi beat Miz back and went to go to the top turnbuckle, only for Miz to trip him up and send the champion crashing to the floor.
****Commercial****
We came back to Miz hitting a big lariat before scoring with a series of mounted punches. Miz connected with a leg drop for a two count before hitting some more stomps.

Kofi went to follow up on a near fall and was almost rolled up for a two count. Kofi hit the boom boom leg drop for a two count, only for the Miz to roll to the outside. He hung Kofi up on the ropes and connected with a running knee but couldn’t get the back slide. The two duked it out in the middle of the ring until Kofi hit a series of forearms and a drop kick.
Kingston went to the top rope and hit a cross body but Miz rolled through for a two count. Kingston then connected with SOS, but couldn’t get the job done. He missed a splash in the corner, only for Miz to catch him in the skull-crushing finale for the win and the title.

Chris Jericho & Big Show vs. D-X
Jericho and Triple H locked horns and headed to the corner. Triple H connected with some punches and a shoulder block that flat backed Jericho. Michaels tagged in and Jericho was quickly able to assume the advantage. Jericho tagged in Big Show and Michaels was able to quickly escape and tag in the Game.
****Commercial****
We came back to Show holding Triple H in a bear hug. Triple H attempted to kick out but was belted onto his back yet again by a Big Show frying pan chop. Jericho tagged in and put the boots to Triple H before kicking him hard in the gut.
Jericho kept up the pressure, choking Triple H on the ropes and then standing on his neck. He went for a big splash, only for Triple H to dodge him. Triple H got the hot tag and Michaels went right into his victory sequence. Jericho cut Michaels off and whipped him hard to the buckles before kicking him in the small of the back. Big Show tagged in and dropped a huge leg drop across his chest for a two count.
Jericho tagged back in, only for Michaels to try and fight back. Jericho cut him off yet again though, hitting him with a hard lariat. Jericho uncorked a back breaker and a second Irish whip. He slapped on the walls of Jericho and Michaels looks to be in a lot of trouble. Triple H broke up the party, only for Jericho to tag in Show.
Show missed Michaels in the corner on a charge attempt and allowed Michaels to almost hit the hot tag. Finally, he hit an enzeguri and tagged Triple H. Triple H came in a house of fire and connected with a huge face buster. Big Show grabbed him only for Jericho to accidentally knock him to the apron. Show reversed a suplex attempt and hit both Triple H and Michaels with one of his own. The action spilled to the outside where the DX members were able to post Show and clothesline him into the crowd.
When Jericho realized it was just him and DX, he took off for the back only for Big Ben and his offensive line to come out to the ramp and cut him off. Jericho was rushed back to the ring and he ate a big sweet chin music. That’s all she wrote.
Winners: DX via pin fall
Show Thoughts-- All things considered, this Raw implemented their guest GM as well as any show since they started to use the gimmick.
While you could do a lot with Ben, they stayed pretty safe, and worked him around some of the more over acts on the show. The DX/Jerishow segment came off really well, as did the match at the end. They really did a good job building to the main event and making everything seem like a real big deal and from the crowd reaction, you could tell they succeeded.
I have to say I have a very bi-polar relationship with Triple H and Shawn Michaels these days, but the DX reunion has been a lot of fun this time around. No more aimless squashes, no more smooshing, none of that. Instead, we’ve gotten a series of pretty good tag matches. Tonight however, was their best showing. Triple H and Michaels are two dudes whom I enjoy in tag team matches, largely due to the fact that their weaknesses are largely guarded against. Triple H has some great hot tag offense and Michaels isn’t forced to sell for long periods of time, where as we’ve moved into the twilight of his career, we’ve seen him get hugely lazy with. Great effort tonight and I’m always willing to eat crow when it warrants it. Get me a bib, I’m a messy eater.
If you’re not psyched up for the John Cena-Randy Orton match, then you really must hate wrestling. We’ve got a Ironman, No DQ, No Count out, Loser Leaves Town Title match. What is this Mid South? Cena paces his matches perhaps better than anyone and it’ll be especially interesting to see if Orton can go an hour. Still though, this should be a total brawl, which’ll be a lot of fun. With Smackdown’s TV deal coming up soon, Cena losing and ending up on Smackdown isn’t out of the realm of possibility or isn’t as unlikely as people may think. I love these two paired up and this is easily the most excited I’ve been for any of their matches together.
The Miz as US Champion is something I’m a big advocate of. In fact, I thought both he and Kofi had as good a match as they’re capable of having tonight on television. Kofi’s hugely over, and while I’m not sure if he has the tools to stay over, it’s still worth a mini-push into main event land to see what might be possible at the top of the card. The WWE’s really protected him (he’s got the best record on the brand) and he seems over enough to risk it. Miz on the other hand, is at this point. He’s great on the mic. I think he’s proficient in the ring as well, but now’s the time to showcase him and get him a little more over.
On a side note, some were balking about this title switch not happening last night. The mid card belts are more like TV titles these days. The purpose of them is to get mid carders more exposure. If Exposure is the goal, then having the title switch hands on pay per view makes no sense, because there are fewer viewers. I hope that clears things up for people.
The Divas division is a real mess right now. Mickie James might be the poorest performing wrestler on the roster right now, and no, it’s not because her opponents suck. She’s had bad matches with Beth Phoenix, Gail Kim, Alicia, and Maryse. She’s not having bad matches just with bad opponents. She’s having bad matches with good opponents. Mickie may execute well, but outside of that, she’s got no idea of how to put a coherent match together unless there’s a Trish Stratus type to totally carry her. Last night she was flat out embarrassing, and that has nothing to do with the finisher botch. There was a Thesz press where Mickie clearly forgot what to do. She’s out of place on set spots and sometimes, blatantly no-sells other people’s offense. I really fail to see the big deal about her as right now, as she’s cleanly the worst worker on the roster. And yes, doing stuff other people aren’t capable of doing is bad wrestling. As a competent wrestler, you should know your opponents limitations and work within them. It’s the reality of it. I don’t think Mickie has a clue. She had a ton of potential, but that seems to have faded over the years.
On a totally random and somewhat unrelated note, has the wrestling media become that bored or gossipy that they’re trying to make the case that a business decision was made because another person didn’t wear a tie? The lack of journalistic integrity is a daily embarrassment around the interweb, and it’s a wonder that people who work for sites like ours still wonder why the WWE won’t grant them interviews, etc. Maybe it’s because you make stuff up and as a result, call your integrity into question? Who was at the Taker-Punk conversation and how do they know that’s what they talked about? Wasn’t it reported for MONTHS that Taker was scheduled to win the belt at Breaking Point? Where do people come up with this stuff? How would Cena know what John Cena wears from TV taping to TV taping as they’re on different brands? I’m sorry your favorite wrestler didn’t win, but can we stop it with the ‘PUNK IN DA DOGHOUSE~’ stories every time he loses a world title? Just because he’s not cleanly beating Taker, Cena, HBK and Triple H on a nightly basis does not put him in the dog house.
Simply put, it amazes me how internet fans will believe anything they hear.
What’s probably even funnier is that for a guy who’s been in the ‘dog house’ as much as CM Punk has, he sure is pushed hard… This is the same guy who has been pushed in the upper mid card-main event scene for the entire time he’s been with the company. He’s had three world title reigns in three years, been an ECW Champion, an Intercontinental Champion as well as half of the World Tag Team Champions. That doesn’t sound like a guy ‘in the doghouse’ to me. So can internet wrestling ‘journalists’ just stop lying and making things up? Those of us who try to maintain some assemblance of integrity would really appreciate it. I’m sure the wrestlers would, too.
I’m still waiting to hear that John Cena lost his belt because he ate the last piece of pizza.

WWE Champion: Randy Orton 15-14-5, 41 pts. (Last Week: 1)-- In today’s wrestling world, it doesn’t get much bigger than a clean victory of John Cena’s in perhaps the ‘biggest’ match in the WWE these days. I don’t know if there’s been a match I’ve looked more forward to in the last couple of years than the Iron Man, Loser Leaves Town match coming up at Bragging Rights.
United States Champion: The Miz 8-10-2, 16 Points (Last Week: 9)-- Finally gets the nod for the US title, which I think is pretty well deserved. Its time for the rubber to meet the road with the Miz, so hopefully they continue to showcase him.
1. John Cena 21-13-5, 47 points. (Last Week: WWE Champion) -- Orton-Cena is quickly becoming the yin to the yang rivalry of this generation. Every match these guys have together should make creative kick themselves for not pulling the trigger on this at Wrestlemania.
2. Triple H 9-7-3, 15 Points (Last Week: 3)-- Triple H and Michaels are both guys who I think benefit greatly from tag matches. They’re more structured and Triple H’s offense seems far better suited for it. The pressure to sell over a long period of time isn’t there for Michaels, so his stuff is far more compact. Either way, I’ve immensely enjoyed the DX reunion, which isn’t something I could have imagined myself saying a few months ago.
3. Big Show 11-12-1, 18 Points (Last Week: 2)-- Show’s outfit was awesome. He looked like one of my grandfather’s friends. I was waiting for him to pull out a pack of lucky strikes out of his front pocket.
4. Shawn Michaels 12-4, 19 pts. (Last Week: 8)--see Triple H.
5. Cody Rhodes 12-14-3, 17 points (Last Week: 4)--All in all, a great run for these guys. Dibiase might have had his career match thus far in Hell in a Cell, and Rhodes has been looking consistently better every week.
6. Ted Dibiase, Jr. 11-11-3, 13 Points (Last Week: 5)--See Rhodes.
7. Kofi Kingston 20-6-2, 40 points (Last Week: US Champion)-- Of the midcard guys right now, Kofi’s clearly the most over, although I’d probably argue that in terms of where he’s at in the ring, he’s probably one of the lesser guys. Still, in wrestling, popularity is the currency which means he might be in line for a push. They’ve really done everything they can with him with the US title for now, so it’s time to move him up the card and see if he sticks at all.
8. Mark Henry, 11-4, 19 Points (Last Week: 6)-- Twisted his knee up pretty bad in that tag match, so I’m hoping all is well. He’s been so great in the ring, it’d be a shame to see an injury derail his recent progress.
9. MVP 12-10-2, 20 Points (Last Week: 7)--MVP’s looked good coming off the Jericho/Big Show feud. I’d still like to see his offense be a little bit more targeted and not see as much meandering when on the advantage. He sells well enough, but his offense is all over the place. I can say that about almost every mid card baby face in this company right now, though.
10. Jack Swagger, 6-8-2, 11 Points (Last Week: NR) -- I’m fascinated to see where Swagger goes from here. I think from a skills standpoint, he’s the most gifted of the Raw crop of mid carders. I’d like to see them push him up the card. If Cena ends up with the belt, a title shot on Raw might be some interesting stuff.

"Kofi Kingston def. Sami Zayn
November 7, 2017
Fresh off their verbal exchange mere moments ago, Kingston and Zayn squared off on SmackDown LIVE with The New Day and Kevin Owens in their respective corners. Intensity and athleticism was at a premium as the two went back and forth with razor-sharp intensity. Zayn took control for large spurts, never hesitating to cut any corner possible to gain an edge. However, Kofi battled back by throwing caution to the wind several times, even launching himself head-over-heals over the top rope onto his opponent, and his go-for-broke approach finally paid off when The Dreadlocked Dynamo caught Zayn totally offguard with a splash from the top rope for the win.
Instantly, KO hit the ring to pounce on Kofi and sneak in a few cheap shots before The New Day could break it up. By the time Big E and Xavier Woods got there, Owens and Zayn had fled, but it seemed rather evident that a serious conflict was brewing between the two sides.

"With Bobby Roode’s United States Title reign now in full swing, a quartet of Team Blue’s finest squared off in a Fatal-4 Way Match to determine who would get the next opportunity at The Glorious One for the prestigious championship. Roode sat in on commentary as Rusev, Kofi Kingston, Zack Ryder and Jinder Mahal pushed one another to their limits as they all tried to earn the coveted title opportunity.
A chaotic opening saw Ryder and Kofi whipping out high-risk maneuvers on top of the remaining New Day members, while Aiden English and Sunil Singh caused a ruckus at ringside. Xavier Woods, Big E, English and Singh were soon ejected from the ringside area, paving the way for an even playing field.
Rusev showed off tremendous agility at the end of the match, evading his opponents’ best shots and seamlessly locking Kofi in The Accolade for the tapout victory.
After his win (on Rusev Day, no less), The Super Athlete made his way to the commentary desk to stare down Roode one week before their title showdown on SmackDown LIVE!

The character sprites have shifted a few pixels to the left in the Korean title screen.
Janken Battle

In the Japanese version only, the animation for a character losing in a game of Janken would result in them losing their clothes. All other versions however change this to an anvil falling on their heads. Also, the final boss will be covering himself after his defeat in the Japanese version, while in other versions he just keeps waving his arms.
The Korean version replaces the ""Janken-Po!"" voice sample with the stage start jingle.
Sound Test
|Japan||International||Korea|
The Japanese sound test menu has a slightly odd color palette, mainly noted to the small hand icon. The palette was fixed in the international versions. The entire font was also replaced, removing the drop shadow in the process, as well as replacing the letter M with another N seemingly by accident. The Korean version has ""Janken"" removed for various legal reasons, however it does fix the M letter.

"Kylie Minogue Has Breast Cancer
Australian pop star Kylie Minogue announced Tuesday that she has breast cancer, saying in a written statement that she's postponing her current concert tour to seek treatment and apologizing to fans.
Minogue's management company that the 36-year-old's diagnosis was confirmed this week during a visit to the southern Australian city of Melbourne, her hometown.
""Whilst at home in Melbourne with her family this week prior to her Australian Showgirl Tour, Kylie was diagnosed with early breast cancer,"" the statement said. ""She will undergo immediate treatment and consequently her Australian tour will not be able to proceed as planned.""
In the statement, Minogue said: ""I was so looking forward to bringing the Showgirl tour to Australian audiences, and am sorry to have to disappoint my fans. Nevertheless, hopefully all will work out fine and I'll be back with you all again soon.""
Minogue had concerts booked in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth over the next month as part of her Showgirl world tour. She also had shows scheduled in Singapore on June 17 and Hong Kong on June 23.
Michael Gudinski, head of Frontier Touring, the company promoting her Australian tour, said it was ""way too early to tell"" when Minogue might resume her tour and that it was appropriate to postpone the tour indefinitely to ""let her find her space and deal with it.""
""I'm just hoping and praying because the doctors found it so early that everything will be OK,"" he told Australia's Seven television network.
""Our thoughts and I'm sure many, many legions of Kylie fans will be with her all the way,"" he said.
Minogue made her name as a star of the long-running Australian soap opera ""Neighbours"" before launching her singing career with hits such as ""I Should Be So Lucky"" and ""Better the Devil You Know.""
Her popularity soared after her critically acclaimed 2001 album ""Fever"" which reached No. 1 in charts around the world and No. 3 in the Billboard album chart, and a series of raunchy video clips released with singles such as ""Can't Get You Out of My Head.""
""Fever"" sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, according to Minogue's Web site.
In late 2003 her song ""Slow"" became Minogue's seventh No. 1 single in Britain, 15 years and nine months after I Should Be So Lucky"" topped the charts there in 1988 for her first No. 1 hit. ""Slow"" also was nominated for a Grammy.
In the past, Minogue has auctioned one of her bras to raise money for breast cancer research and worked to raise awareness of prostate cancer, after her father was diagnosed with it.
Australian singer Delta Goodrem, who followed in Minogue's footsteps from ""Neighbors"" to pop stardom, was diagnosed in 2003 with Hodgkins disease, a form of lymphatic cancer.

"The creators of the site are thought to include political activists and open-source software engineers, though they are keeping their identities secret. Their goal is to ensure that whistle-blowers and journalists are not thrown into jail for emailing sensitive documents. That was the fate of Chinese journalist Shi Tao, who was sentenced to a 10-year term in 2005 after publicising an email from Chinese officials about the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
According to the group's website www.wikileaks.org, its primary targets include China, Russia, and oppressive regimes in Eurasia, the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. It is not limited to these countries, however, and people anywhere will be able to use the site to reveal unethical behaviour by governments and corporations.
Normally an email or a document posted to a website can be traced back to its source because each data packet carries the IP address of the last server that it passed through. To prevent this, WikiLeaks will exploit an anonymising protocol known as The Onion Router (Tor), which routes data through a network of servers that use cryptography to hide the path that the packets took. Bruce Schneier, a cryptographer based in Silicon Valley, California, explains it like this. ""Imagine a large room jammed full of people in which many of them are passing around envelopes. How would you know where any of them started?""
Julien Pain, a campaigner with Reporters Without Borders in Paris, France, sees Tor as a valuable step towards guaranteeing anonymity. ""Enabling cyber-dissidents to leak information is a crucial issue we now face in many countries,"" he says. There are however, fears that whistle-blowers might still be at risk. ""I would not trust my life or even my liberty to Tor,"" says Ben Laurie, a London-based computer security expert. In the past, determined cryptographers have breached Tor's security, and though each breach has led to improvements to Tor there is always a risk others will be discovered.
The WikiLeaks team do not plan to control what is disclosed on the site, raising fears that the anonymity it offers could be misused. ""The initiative could drown in fabricated documents, pornographic records or become hijacked to serve vendettas,"" warns Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists in Washington DC.
The safeguard against this, according to the WikiLeaks team, is that false postings will be sniffed out by users, who will be free to comment on what is posted. This is what happens with Wikipedia, which although unconnected to WikiLeaks is based on the same open-source software. ""WikiLeaks will provide a forum for the entire global community to examine any document relentlessly for credibility,"" the site claims. WikiLeaks is raising funds and testing its software. It hopes tolaunch in February. - New Scientist

"Innovation is a lot like new, except it's got more letters in it
US DISTRICT COURT Judge Jeffrey White did a U-turn on his own earlier order in San Francisco on Friday, reversing suppression of the whistleblower website Wikileaks.
Swiss bank Julius Baer had obtained the injunction on February 15 by alleging that Wikileaks was publishing confidential documents that violated its client's right to privacy. The controversial papers tended to suggest that the bank and its client might have been involved in some tax evasion and money laundering.
Wikileaks' US ISP Dynadot complied with Judge White's order and removed its DNS entries, but the website was still accessible via its numeric IP address. In addition, online activists immediately mirrored Wikileaks at dozens of alternate websites worldwide. The ensuing publicity made headlines almost everywhere.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a motion protesting the censorship of Wikileaks, and The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP) assembled a media coalition that filed a friend of the court brief on Wikileaks' behalf.
The media coalition comprised almost all of the major US newspaper publishers and press organisations, including -- in addition to the RCFP -- the American Society of Newspaper Editors, The Associated Press, the Citizen Media Law Project, The E.W. Scripps Company, the Gannett Company, The Hearst Corporation, the Los Angeles Times, the National Newspaper Association, the Newspaper Association of America, The Radio-Television News Directors Association, and The Society of Professional Journalists.
On the grounds that Wikileaks had not appeared in court to defend itself and no First Amendment issues had yet been raised before the court, the press coalition requested to be heard as a friend of the court to call attention to relevant points of law that the court had apparently overlooked.
In a twenty-three page brief, with one voice most of the US fourth estate argued:
""First, Wikileaks provides a forum for dissidents and whistleblowers across the globe to post documents, but the Dynadot injunction imposes a prior restraint that drastically curtails access to Wikileaks from the Internet based on a limited number of postings challenged by Plaintiffs. The Dynadot injunction therefore violates the bedrock principle that an injunction cannot enjoin all communication by a publisher or other speaker.
""Second, the [Temporary Restraining Order] against Wikileaks violates the First Amendment because judicial orders enjoining reporting on or dissemination of documents constitute prior restraints. Under Pentagon Papers, the First Amendment prohibits prior restraints in nearly every circumstance, even where national security may be at risk and the press's source is alleged to have obtained the documents unlawfully. The privacy and commercial interests Plaintiffs cite are simply not on the same order of magnitude required to justify a prior restraint, and the grab bag of federal, state and foreign laws they cite do not authorize prior restraints.
""Third, both the [Temporary Restraining Order] and Dynadot injunction lack the rigorous findings required for a prior restraint and are far broader than constitutionally permissable, as the [Temporary Restraining Order] purports to reach anyone with ""notice,"" not just parties, and is not narrowly tailored.
""Finally, the [Temporary Restraining Order] and Dynadot injunction are precluded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which prohibits injunctive relief against websites and services such as Wikileaks and Dynadot for publishing information provided by third parties."" (All citations omitted.)
Faced with such concerted and well founded opposition from the press, Judge White not only dissolved the injunction requiring Dynadot to suppress Wikileaks' DNS entries but also denied the plaintiff's request for an order prohibiting the website's publication.
In a press release, RCFP Executive Director Lucy Dalglish said, ""It's not very often a federal judge does a 180 degree turn in a case and dissolves an order. But we're very pleased the judge recognized the constitutional implications in this prior restraint.""

What I find really amusing is how they say the sight needs to be taken down because they're posting confidential documents. Then they say that the documents are fake and they're not doing tax evasion or money laundry. How can a document be confidential and/or proprietary if it's fake?
The judge didn't know enough about the law to realize the request was wrong. This judge, like so many other judges, needs to be removed from office. Any judge who doesn't know the law he's ruling on needs to be shown the door. -Mike",https://web.archive.org/web/20100203065021/http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1039527/judge-rethinks-wikileaks
"The US army's archives contain descriptions of at least 21 separate occasions in which British troops are said to have shot or bombed Afghan civilians, including women and children.
The logs identify at least 26 people killed and another 20 wounded as a result. Some casualties were accidentally caused by air strikes, but many also are said to involve British troops firing on unarmed drivers or motorcyclists who come ""too close"" to convoys or patrols. Their injuries result from what are described as ""warning shots"" or ""disabling shots"" fired into the engine block, as required by the military's ""escalation of force"" regulations.
The number of dead and wounded alleged to have been caused by the British include 16 children, at least three women and a mentally ill man. The number is a small fraction of the 369 civilian casualties listed in the logs as due to coalition – mostly US – action in total.
More than 320 UK soldiers have also been killed since British troops were deployed to Helmand. But the war logs describe two disturbing clusters of British shootings that do not appear to have been properly investigated.
There is an unusual group of four shootings all in Kabul, in barely more than a single month, October 2007. The perpetrators are not identified in the logs and on one occasion the Americans report: ""Investigation is controlled by the British. We [are] not able to get the complete story.""
Among UK squads in Kabul at that time were a detachment of the Coldstream Guards. It is not known whether they were involved in any of the shootings, but their unofficial blog, ShinyCapstar, describes the atmosphere that October at Camp Souter in Kabul: ""The overriding threat is that of suicide bombers of which there have been a number in the recent past.""
The first incident is reported on 4 October 2007. The US log says a non-combatant was wounded with two or three bullets and taken by ""the UK company"" to Camp Warehouse. ""An investigation is pending.""
On 21 October, three civilian interpreters were said to be wounded when their vehicle ""was fired upon by a UK vehicle near Camp Blackhorse … Investigation is controlled by the British. "" Four days later ""a warning shot was fired by a British soldier"" which ricocheted and wounded a passerby. And on 6 November: ""UK Coy reported force escalation"". According to the Americans, the son of an Afghan general died of the subsequent gunshot wounds: ""There could be some demonstration.""
A second cluster of eight shootings, involve Royal Marine commandos in Helmand in the six months from October 2008. Further shootings involve British ""mentoring units"" sent to work with Afghan police and soldiers. There are also four recorded instances of air strikes called in by the UK resulting in casualties to civilians.
A Harrier bombing is listed as killing eight people. In another an F16 jet called in by a Rifles squad radioed afterwards that it could see ""bodies being picked up in the target area"". Seven civilians were wounded and one killed in that attack.
A further Apache helicopter strike outside Kandahar was claimed to have killed three Taliban: but it proved later that two women and two children had died.
A Hellfire missile blast from an unmanned drone over Helmand was also claimed to have killed six Taliban. It later transpired it had wounded two children.
British troops at a checkpoint in Sangin killed four and wounded three civilians in July. In August a 2 Para squad rocketed what it thought were insurgents, killing three civilians and wounding four. And in September an unarmed motorcyclist was shot dead by a British patrol.
There is also at least one episode of UK shootings which the war logs cover up. On 3 December 2006 the US database merely records that a convoy struck an IED in Kandahar, wounding three Royal Marines and causing 25 civilian casualties.
But Guardian correspondent Declan Walsh, who was on the scene, interviewed victims in hospital. Witnesses described a shooting spree in which vengeful or scared UK soldiers shot at bystanders, killing two and wounding five. The MoD never publicly investigated these allegations.
The Guardian put allegations of the two clusters of British shootings to the MoD three days ago. It said: ""We have been unable to corroborate these claims in the short time available and it would be inappropriate to speculate on specific cases without further verification of the alleged actions.""",http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/british-troops-afghan-civilian-shootings?intcmp=239
"The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, today hailed the person responsible for leaking the diplomatic cables as ""an unparalleled hero"" and suggested that his organisation had deliberately used servers in certain jurisdictions, such as Amazon's in the US, to test their commitment to freedom of speech.
In a live Q&A on theguardian.com, the Australian journalist highlighted the role alleged to have been played in the leaks by the soldier Bradley Manning.
""For the past four years one of our goals has been to lionise the source who take the real risks in nearly every journalistic disclosure and without whose efforts, journalists would be nothing,"" said Assange. ""If indeed it is the case, as alleged by the Pentagon, that the young soldier – Bradley Manning – is behind some of our recent disclosures, then he is without doubt an unparalleled hero.""
Assange was answering questions online as it was claimed that he faced imminent arrest. AFP reported that the Swedish authorities had issued a new international arrest warrant containing information requested by British police.
During the live Q&A, Assange responded to Amazon.com's decision earlier this week to pull the plug on hosting WikiLeaks. On Wednesday, the company announced it was cutting off WikiLeaks after being contacted by the staff of Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's committee on homeland security.
He said: ""Since 2007 we have been deliberately placing some of our servers in jurisdictions that we suspected suffered a free speech deficit in order to separate rhetoric from reality. Amazon was one of these cases.""
His comments on the matter came after WikiLeaks tweeted that if Amazon was ""so uncomfortable with the first amendment, they should get out of the business of selling books.""
Despite facing arrest warrants over allegations of sexual crimes in Sweden, Assange found time to answer a reader's question about extraterrestrial life.
Asked whether WikiLeaks had ever received documents relating to UFOs, he said: ""Many weirdos email us about UFOs or how they discovered that they were the antichrist whilst talking with their ex-wife at a garden party over a pot-plant.""
However, he said, none had yet satisfied the twin publishing criteria: ""that the documents not be self-authored; that they be original.""
But he added: ""It is worth noting that in yet-to-be-published parts of the cablegate archive there are indeed references to UFOs.""
Meanwhile, Assange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, told the Guardian that neither he nor his colleagues had heard from police about the arrest warrants.
""We had an understanding with Scotland Yard of long standing that in the event they wanted to contact Julian Assange they would come to us and we would facilitate a congenial and convenient meeting,"" he said.
""I hope the police remember their undertaking. I've had no indication that anyone wants to talk to Julian at this moment in time; no member of his legal team has had a call from any law enforcement agency.""",http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/dec/03/julian-assange-live-online-answers
"I am part of the new generation that has lived in Tunisia under the absolute rule of President Ben Ali.
In high school and college, we are always afraid to talk politics: ""There are reporters everywhere,"" we are told. Nobody dares discussing politics in public; everyone is suspicious. Your neighbour, your friend, your grocer might be Ben Ali's informer: do you or your father want to be forcibly taken to an undefined place one night at 4am?
We grow up with this fear of activism; we continue studying, going out and partying, regardless of politics.
During high school, we begin to find out the intricacies of the ""royal"" family and hear stories here and there – about a relative of Leila [Trabelsi, the president's wife] who took control of an industry, who has appropriated the land of another person, who dealt with the Italian mafia. We talk and discuss it among ourselves – everybody is aware of what's going on, but there is no action. We quickly learn that Tunisian television is the worst television that exists. Everything is relayed to the glory of President Ben Ali, who's always shown at his best. We all know he dyes his hair black. Nobody likes his wife, who has a wooden smile: she never seemed sincere.
We do not live, but we think we do. We want to believe that all is well since we are part of the middle class, but we know that if the cafes are packed during the day, it is because the unemployed are there discussing football. The first nightclubs open their doors and we begin to go out, to drink and enjoy the nightlife around Sousse and Hammamet. Other stories are circulating – about a Trabelsi who gave someone a horrible kicking because he felt like it, or another who caused a car accident only to return home to sleep. We exchange stories, quietly, quickly. In our own way, it is a form of vengeance: by gossiping, we have the feeling we're plotting.
The police are afraid: if you tell them you're close to Ben Ali all doors open, hotels offer their best rooms, parking becomes free, traffic laws disappear.
The internet is blocked, and censored pages are referred to as pages ""not found"" – as if they had never existed. Schoolchildren are exchanging proxies and the word becomes cult: ""You got a proxy that works?""
We all know that Leila has tried to sell a Tunisian island, that she wants to close the American school in Tunis to promote her own school – as I said, stories are circulating. Over the internet and under the desks, we exchange ""La régente de Carthage"" [a controversial book about the role of Leila Trabelsi and her family in Tunisia]. We love our country and we want things to change, but there is no organised movement: the tribe is willing, but the leader is missing.
The corruption, the bribes – we simply want to leave. We begin to apply to study in France, or Canada. It is cowardice, and we know it. Leaving the country to ""the rest of them"". We go to France and forget, then come back for the holidays. Tunisia? It is the beaches of Sousse and Hammamet, the nightclubs and restaurants. A giant ClubMed.
And then, WikiLeaks reveals what everyone was whispering. And then, a young man immolates himself. And then, 20 Tunisians are killed in one day.
And for the first time, we see the opportunity to rebel, to take revenge on the ""royal"" family who has taken everything, to overturn the established order that has accompanied our youth. An educated youth, which is tired and ready to sacrifice all the symbols of the former autocratic Tunisia with a new revolution: the Jasmine Revolution – the true one.

EO 12958 DECL: 01/01/2020
TAGS PREL, PGOV, PINR, IT
SUBJECT: VISITING WITH A RECUPERATING BERLUSCONI
ROME 00000001 001.2 OF 003
Classified By: Ambassador David H. Thorne. Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).
1. C) Summary: The Ambassador visited recuperating Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Lombardy estate for a private luncheon December 30. The Ambassador had suggested he visit Berlusconi after the Prime Minister was assaulted at a Milan rally in mid-December. Accompanied by Gianni Letta, the Undersecretary in the Prime Minister's office and effectively Berlusconi's second in command, Ambassador flew up for the meeting on the Prime Minister's plane. Bandaged and bruised from the December attack, Berlusconi was nonetheless upbeat and eager to show off his new project for training Italy's elite and share his thoughts on European leaders and domestic politics. Berlusconi was effusive about U.S.-Italian relations and Letta promised action on roping in ENI operations in Iran and pushing ahead on Megaports. End Summary
The Recuperating Prime Minister
-------------------------------
2. C) Following the Ambassador's call to Gianni Letta suggesting the Ambassador visit the Prime Minister during his recuperation, Letta, the Undersecretary in the Prime Minister's Office, invited Ambassador Thorne to accompanied him to Milan on December 30 for a private afternoon with the Prime Minister. The three hour session, held in Italian, involved only the Prime Minister, Letta and the Ambassador, and included a visit to Berlusconi's latest endeavor, a private training school for Italy's elite, and a wide-ranging lunch with the two top decision makers in the Italian government.
3. C) Berlusconi was still bandaged and scarred from the assault in early December where a mentally unstable man hurled a die cast model of Milan's cathedral at his head. Berlusconi noted that the missile had struck a glancing blow to his cheek, cutting him, breaking his nose and some of his teeth, but if it had hit him straight on ""it would have killed"" him. Letta recounted separately that Berlusconi had slumped into a depression following the attack - ""he's an impresario, he wants everyone to love him "" - but that had snapped out of it and was on the mend. Letta also noted that their tour of Berlusconi's new project site was the Prime Minister's first excursion outdoors since his release from the hospital.
U.S.-Italy: A Prized Relationship
---------------------------------
4. C) In luncheon discussions, Berlusconi unabashedly stated that he prized Italy's relationship with the U.S. and that his government stood ready to help us, whatever the issue. He noted that Italy owed the United States a debt of gratitude for salvation during World War II, and for protection throughout the Cold War. On Afghanistan, basing issues, and other tough problems, Italy was committed to helping the U.S. get to the right solution. He noted that he hoped that the Italian increase in Afghanistan would help President Obama and address the situation on the ground.
Berlusconi on European Leaders
------------------------------
5. C) The Prime Minister and Letta also gave their run down of current European political leadership. Berlusconi assessed that Sarkozy's star was clearly waning in European circles and that the French President did not command the same influence he did a year ago. Letta was less convinced, noting to the Ambassador that both Berlusconi and Sarkozy were ""big dogs angling for the same spotlight."" Berlusconi recounted how he had played an instrumental role in the Spring in persuading a reluctant Erdogan to accept Danish PM Rasmussen as the new NATO Secretary General, overcoming the Turkish President's profound irritation at Rasmussen for not silencing Kurdish language radio stations despite numerous requests. On Russia, Berlusconi felt that Putin and Medvedev got along well, respected each other, and had an effective relationship. In fact, farewells after lunch were unexpectedly cut short by an incoming call from Putin.
Iran: Appalled by violence, Will try to rope in ENI
--------------------------------------------- ------
6. C) On Iran, Berlusconi noted that he was appalled by the Iranian crackdown. He offered the capabilities of the Italian intelligence services and assured full sharing of information gathered on the internal dynamics in Tehran. Letta, as the supervising authority over Italy's intelligence services, assured the Ambassador of a continuation of our
ROME 00000001 002.2 OF 003
already excellent bilateral cooperation on the issue. Letta also promised that he would talk to ENI CEO Scaroni about the energy giant's ongoing operations in Iran and, if he could, persuade them to halt activities.
Megaports - GOI to determine POC
--------------------------------
7. C) In response to the U.S. request to move forward on Megaports, Letta told the Ambassador that the issue would be discussed at the Council of Ministers meeting on January 8 and that they would be in contact soon thereafter to convey which ministry would have lead in the GOI for implementing the project and as such be the primary interlocutor for our Embassy.
Italy's Courts - Problem Number One
-----------------------------------
8. C) Berlusconi forthrightly identified the magistratura - Italy's judiciary and courts -- as Italy's ""biggest problem"" and told the Ambassador that he was ready to forge an alliance with the center left opposition to implement judicial reform. He noted that a legal system where issues were never definitively resolved -- where you can be absolved of a crime and yet have the case resurrected later - sapped Italy's political and economic system. He argued that this is what has happened in his own case, where he has been cleared in the past but the same charges keep on returning repeatedly. He said that he had allies in the opposition on the need for reform, including PD Leader Bersani. Letta cautioned the government won't know if it has the clout to deliver on such an idea unless it secures a decent showing in regional elections in March 2010.
Smart Guys in the Opposition
----------------------------
9. C) Berlusconi and Letta displayed a great deal of respect for opposition leaders. Berlusconi praised the Democratic Party Leader, Pier Luigi Bersani as a ""straight shooter"" who was fair with a top rate intellect. Separately Letta was also complimentary about former Prime Minister (and archrival) Massimo D'Alema who he credited with showing courage and integrity during the Balkans crisis and taking some very tough decisions. Letta noted that D'Alema's prickliness and ""smartest guy in the room"" demeanor made dealing with him a chore, but acknowledged his judgment and political effectiveness, which was why Berlusconi backed him for the EU Foreign Minister position despite their differences. Letta told the Ambassador that he did not have a clear judgment on how DiPietro will play in domestic politics and looked forward to future conversations. On other domestic political issues, Letta thought that the current estrangement between the governing PDL party and Sicilian President Lombardo was a minor issue and they would patch it up quickly.
Worried about a flat 2010
-------------------------
10. C) Both Berlusconi and Letta expressed concern about the limited prospects for economic growth in 2010. Berlusconi thought that Italy had weathered the past year of the financial crisis fairly well but thought it would be a challenge to produce enough growth in 2010 to start replacing jobs lost. The Prime Minister was less concerned that a financial meltdown in Greece would have EU-wide impact. He said that he had a good relationship with Greek PM Papendreou and was confident that he could right the situation.
New Media - Important for Liberty
---------------------------------
11. C) In response to the Ambassador's questions to the Prime Minister about the role of the internet, Berlusconi shot back ""it's important for liberty."" New media - particularly Facebook which has been instrumental in the past month in organizing a national ""No Berlusconi Day"" and more controversially in continuing to host ""Kill Berlusconi"" pages - has vexed the GOI, - but the Prime Minister stated that he felt the evolving media was both critical to the future and also to the preservation of liberty. But he felt there needed to be better tuned controls to prevent the most extreme use of the new outlets.
The Berlusconi Leadership Academy
---------------------------------
12. C) The Prime Minister commenced the visit by personally
ROME 00000001 003.2 OF 003
conducting a guided tour of his most recent project, a private academy to train Italy's brightest young minds. Berlusconi led Letta and the Ambassador on a personal tour of a newly rehabbed Lombardy estate that will serve as the home of the enterprise. The completely renovated 17th century country mansion, Villa Gernetto, will house a special school set to open in March for one hundred of Italy's most talented young leaders, completely funded from Berlusconi's personal fortune. The Prime Minister intends to choose the students himself and he envisions an environment where Italy's best and brightest live and study, taught by world leaders ""like Blair and Clinton.""
Comment
-------
13. C) The Ambassador's intimate afternoon with Italy's two top decision makers was both a testament to the priority Berlusconi gives the U.S.-Italy relationship but also perhaps a sign that the GOI has achieved its long-sought level comfort and ease with the Obama administration. It is also a dividend of the Ambassador's cultivation of the relationship with Letta, which has opened up a personal channel to the Prime Minister. The Italian press coverage of the following day clearly took this message from what they viewed as an extraordinary private session. The Prime Minister was clear that he expects to be called upon to deliver for the U.S., which he will do out of principle, not self-interest. Despite being given numerous openings, neither the Prime Minister nor Letta asked for anything from the U.S. during the lengthy luncheon. A striking aspect of the session was Letta's clear position as co-regent, with Berlusconi deferring regularly to his colleague and with Letta airing opposing points of view to his boss during the luncheon.

"\section{Introduction}

The strongest motivation for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM)
is dark matter (DM) in the Universe. Among a variety of DM candidates,
weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs) offer the most attractive
paradigm to explain the observed DM density: $\Omega_{\rm DM} h^2 \simeq
0.12$~\cite{Ade:2015xua}. 


Higgsino in a supersymmetric (SUSY) extension of the SM, which is an
SU(2)$_L$ doublet fermion with hypercharge $1/2$, is a prime example of
WIMP DM. The neutral component of Higgsino can mix with the neutral
electroweak-inos, bino and wino, and if the dominant portion of the
lightest state is Higgsino, then it is called a Higgsino-like state. The
amount of the gaugino fractions in a Higgsino-like state strongly
affects its phenomenological property. If the masses of SUSY particles
other than Higgsino, especially those of the electroweak-inos, are in
the multi-TeV region, then the gaugino fraction is quite suppressed and
thus the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) can be regarded as an almost pure
Higgsino. Such a ``split'' mass spectrum has various phenomenological
and theoretical advantages~\cite{Wells:2003tf, *Wells:2004di,
ArkaniHamed:2004fb, *Giudice:2004tc, *ArkaniHamed:2004yi,
*ArkaniHamed:2005yv}, and thus attracts wide
attention \cite{Hall:2011jd,*Hall:2012zp,*Nomura:2014asa, Ibe:2011aa,
*Ibe:2012hu, Arvanitaki:2012ps, ArkaniHamed:2012gw, Evans:2013lpa,
*Evans:2013dza, *Evans:2014pxa} especially after the discovery of the 
125~GeV Higgs boson \cite{Aad:2012tfa, *Chatrchyan:2012ufa, *Aad:2015zhl}.
The gaugino fraction may be small, but non-accelerator experiments such as DM direct searches and measurements of the electric dipole moments (EDMs) can probe it. As
we discuss below, even the gauginos heavier than $\mathcal O(10)\,\text{TeV}$ can be probed in future
experiments \cite{Nagata:2014wma}. 


Another motivation for SU(2)$_L$ doublet DM is provided by
a bottom-up approach. Classifying possible DM candidates
in terms of their quantum numbers, we find that an SU(2)$_L$ doublet
with hypercharge $1/2$ or triplet with hypercharge zero has minimal
non-zero electric charge to accommodate electrically neutral DM.
Hence, SU(2)$_L$ doublet DM is a promising target even
though we do not consider SUSY as new physics beyond the SM.

However, SU(2)$_L$ doublet fermion DM as it is, which
corresponds to completely pure Higgsino DM, has already been
excluded by DM direct detection experiments. In this case, the DM
is a Dirac fermion, and thus has vector interactions with quarks
via the $Z$-boson exchange, which results in a too large 
DM-nucleon spin-independent (SI) scattering cross section \cite{Akerib:2016vxi, *Tan:2016zwf}. 
To avoid this constraint, we need some effects induced at higher energies that 
generate a mass split between the Dirac DM components, $\Delta
m_0$, to divide it into two Majorana fermions $\widetilde
\chi^0_{1,2}$, which do not have vector interactions. To assure this, we
need $\Delta m_0 \gtrsim \mathcal O(100)\,\text{keV}$
\cite{Nagata:2014wma}; otherwise, the inelastic scattering process
$\widetilde\chi^0_{1}N \to \widetilde\chi^0_{2} N$ ($N$ denotes a
nucleon) instead gives a too large scattering cross
section. Generically, the interactions that yield $\Delta
m_0$ should be induced at a scale $\Lambda \lesssim 10^9$~GeV to give
$\Delta m_0 \gtrsim \mathcal O(100)\,\text{keV}$ \cite{Nagata:2014wma,
Nagata:2014aoa}. Such effects are actually similar to the contribution of
gaugino fractions to the property of the Higgsino DM. Thus, this
$\text{SU}(2)_L$ DM can also be probed in future non-accelerator
experiments if the scale $\Lambda$ is relatively low. Notice that bounds
from these experiments give a lower limit on $\Lambda$, while the
inelastic-scattering bound gives an upper limit. 




We however find that there is a range of $\Lambda$
which is high enough for the SU(2)$_L$ doublet fermion DM to be beyond
the reach of these experiments but low enough to give $\Delta m_0
\gtrsim \mathcal O(100)\,\text{keV}$ \cite{Nagata:2014wma, Nagata:2014aoa}---correspondingly, we can find appropriately large
gaugino masses with which the same situation is realized for
Higgsino DM. This situation is completely viable, as the
thermal relic abundance of pure Higgsino DM agrees with $\Omega_{\text{DM}} h^2 \simeq 0.12$ if the Higgsino DM mass $m_{\text{DM}}$ is $\sim 1.1$~TeV
\cite{Cirelli:2007xd}. A
lighter mass region is also promising since there may be non-thermal
contribution from high-energy physics, such as late-time decay of
gravitinos. Therefore, it is quite important to consider an alternative
strategy to probe such almost pure Higgsino DM. 


It has been known that almost pure Higgsino is also difficult to probe
at hadron colliders \cite{Han:2014kaa, Ismail:2016zby}. In this case,
not only the neutral states 
$\widetilde \chi^0_{1,2}$, but also the charged states
$\widetilde\chi^\pm$ are almost degenerate in mass at tree level. The
charged states acquire a slightly heavier mass via the electroweak loop
corrections, but still the mass splitting is as small as $\sim
350$~MeV. Due to this small mass splitting, the decay products of
$\widetilde\chi^\pm$ have soft momenta, which makes it hard to
detect them. For this reason, the current LHC searches for Higgsinos
rely only on mono-jet or mono-$X$ signals, which give poor constraints
on Higgsinos due to large SM background (BG). Even a 100~TeV collider
can test a small portion of parameter space in the Higgsino DM
scenario \cite{Low:2014cba, *Gori:2014oua, *Arkani-Hamed:2015vfh,
*Golling:2016gvc}. 


However, this small mass splitting may offer a different strategy to
probe Higgsinos at colliders. Because of the small mass splitting, the
charged Higgsino has rather long lifetime---as it turns out, a mass
difference of $\sim 350$~MeV results in a decay length of $\sim 1$~cm. It is
therefore interesting to ask whether charged tracks with an ${\cal
O}(1)$~cm length can be detected at collider experiments. In this
letter, we address this question by taking into account potential
improvements in disappearing track searches with fully
optimized inner detectors at the LHC and a future 33~TeV collider. Such
an improvement may also increase the discovery potential of pure wino
DM; thus, we also consider the wino DM case for
comparison. 


\section{Higgsino Phenomenology}

To begin with, we discuss the mass spectrum of Higgsino components,
paying particular attention to the gaugino mass effects on it. 
The masses of these components split after the electroweak symmetry is
broken. These mass splittings are induced by the tree-level mixing with the
electroweak-inos, as well as the electroweak radiative corrections. 
We here assume that the masses of the electroweak-inos are much larger
than the TeV scale. 
At one-loop level, the electroweak-loop contribution to the
charged-neutral mass splitting is given by 
\begin{equation}
\Delta m_{\text{rad}} \simeq \frac 12 \alpha_2 m_Z\sin^2\theta_w
\left(1 -\frac{3m_Z}{2\pi m_{\widetilde\chi^\pm}}\right) ~,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_2\equiv g_2^2/4\pi$ with $g_2$ the SU(2)$_L$ gauge
coupling constant, $m_Z$ is the $Z$-boson mass,
$\theta_w$ is the Weinberg angle, and $m_{\widetilde{\chi}^\pm}$ is the
charged Higgsino mass. We find $\alpha_2 m_Z \sin^2 \theta_w/2
\simeq 355$~MeV. After all, the mass difference between the neutral
components, $\Delta m_0$, and that between the charged component and the
Higgsino LSP, $\Delta m_+$, are respectively given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:massdiff0}
\Delta m_0 &\simeq& \frac{v^2}{4|\mu|}|X| \Delta_X ~,\\ 
\label{eq:massdiffpm}
\Delta m_{+} &=& \Delta m_{\text{tree}} + \Delta m_\text{rad} ~,
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{equation}
 \Delta m_{\text{tree}} \simeq \frac{v^2}{8|\mu|} 
\Bigl[
|X| \Delta_X + \sin2\beta\, \text{Re}(Y)
\Bigr]
\, ,
\end{equation}
where $v\simeq 246$~GeV is the Higgs VEV, $\mu$ is the Higgsino mass,
$\tan\beta \equiv \langle H_u \rangle/\langle H_d \rangle$ with $H_u$
and $H_d$ being the up- and down-type Higgs fields, respectively,
\begin{equation}
 X\equiv \mu^*\left(\frac{g_1^2}{M_1} + \frac{g_2^2}{M_2}\right)~,
~~~
 Y\equiv \mu^*\left(\frac{g_1^2}{M_1} - \frac{g_2^2}{M_2}\right)~,
\end{equation}
$\Delta_X \equiv \sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta_X \sin^2 2\beta}$,
$\theta_{X} \equiv \text{arg}(X)$,
$M_1$ ($M_2$) is the bino (wino) mass, and $g_1$ is the $\text{U}(1)_Y$
gauge coupling. As we discussed above, $\Delta m_0
\gtrsim \mathcal O(100)\,\text{keV}$ is required to suppress the SI
inelastic DM-nucleon scattering via the $Z$-boson exchange. 




Even in this case, the Higgsino-nucleon SI scattering occurs via
the Higgs-boson exchange process induced by the electroweak-ino
mixing. The resultant SI scattering cross section with a proton, for
instance, is evaluated as  
\begin{equation}
 \sigma_{\text{SI}}^{(p)}
\simeq \frac{4m_{\text{red}}^2 m_p^2
}{\pi v^4 m_h^4} 
F^2_{\text{mat}} \Delta m_{\text{tree}}^2
F(X,Y)^2
~,
\label{eq:sigsi}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
 F(X,Y) \equiv \frac{|X| \Delta_X + \sin2\beta\, \text{Re}(X)}
{|X| \Delta_X + \sin2\beta\, \text{Re}(Y)} ~,
\end{equation}
where $m_p$ is the proton mass, $m_h \simeq 125$~GeV is the Higgs mass,
$m_{\text{red}} \equiv m_p m_{\text{DM}}/(m_p + m_{\text{DM}})$,
$F_{\text{mat}} \equiv \sum_{q=u,d,s} f_{T_q} +2f_{T_G}/9$, $f_{T_G}
\equiv 1- \sum_{q=u,d,s} f_{T_q}$, and the mass fractions $f_{T_q}$ are
computed with a QCD lattice simulation as $f_{T_u} = 0.0149$, $f_{T_d} =
0.0234$, and $f_{T_s} = 0.0440$ \cite{Abdel-Rehim:2016won}. In the
derivation of Eq.~\eqref{eq:sigsi}, we have dropped the electroweak-loop
contribution to the SI scattering cross section, which is found to be
negligible for almost pure Higgsino DM \cite{Hisano:2015rsa}. Using this
expression, we find a relation between the SI scattering cross section
and the tree-level charged-neutral mass splitting $\Delta
m_{\text{tree}}$: 
\begin{equation}
 \Delta m_{\text{tree}} \simeq 
\frac{170~\text{MeV}}{F(X,Y)} 
\left(
\frac{m_p}{m_{\text{red}}}
\right)
\biggl(
\frac{\sigma_{\text{SI}}^{(p)}}{10^{-48}~\text{cm}^2}
\biggr)^{\frac{1}{2}}~.
\end{equation}
This equation shows that for a value of $\sigma_{\text{SI}}^{(p)}$ that
exceeds the neutrino floor \cite{Billard:2013qya}, which lies around
$10^{-48}~\text{cm}^2$ for a DM mass of ${\cal O}(100)$ GeV, the
charged-neutral mass splitting is expected to be larger than a few
hundred~MeV. 



In general, the electroweak-ino contribution yields CP violation, which
then induces EDMs of the SM particles. Currently, the electron EDM,
$d_e$, is most stringently restricted: $|d_e| < 8.7 \times 10^{-29}~e\text{cm}$
\cite{Baron:2013eja}. The Higgsino contribution to the
electron EDM is induced by the two-loop Barr--Zee diagrams
\cite{Barr:1990vd, Chang:2005ac, *Deshpande:2005gi, *Giudice:2005rz} and
given by the sum $d_e = d_{e}^{h\gamma} + d_e^{hZ} +
d_e^{WW}$, where $d_{e}^{h\gamma}$, $d_e^{hZ}$, and $d_e^{WW}$ are the
Higgs-$\gamma$, Higgs-$Z$, and $WW$ loop contributions, respectively. 
We find \cite{Nagata:2014wma}
\begin{align}
 d_e^{h\gamma} &\simeq \frac{e g_2^2 m_e \sin 2\beta}{(4\pi)^4
v^2|\mu|}
\biggl(
\frac{8\sin^2\theta_w f_0^h \text{Im}(X-Y)}
{|X| \Delta_X + \sin2\beta\, \text{Re}(Y)}
\biggr) 
\Delta m_{\text{tree}}
~,\nonumber \\
d_e^{WW} &\simeq
\frac{e g_2^2 m_e \sin 2\beta}{(4\pi)^4
v^2|\mu|}
\biggl(
\frac{f_0^W \text{Im}(Y)}
{|X| \Delta_X + \sin2\beta\, \text{Re}(Y)}
\biggr)
\Delta m_{\text{tree}}
~,
\label{eq:edm}
\end{align} 
with $f_0^{h,W} = f_0(|\mu|^2/m_{h,W}^2)$ and
\begin{equation}
 f_0(r) = r\int_0^1  \frac{dx}{r - x(1 - x)}
  \ln\left(\frac{r}{x(1-x)}\right)
\,,
\end{equation}
where $m_e$ is the electron mass, $m_W$ is the $W$-boson mass,  
and $e$ is the positron charge. For the
electron EDM, $d_e^{hZ}$ is always subdominant due to an accidentally
small numerical factor \cite{Nagata:2014wma}. Using this expression, we
can again relate $d_e$ with the mass splitting $\Delta m_{\text{tree}}$
as 
\begin{align}
 d_e \simeq
3\times 10^{-31}\cdot
 \sin(2\beta) 
\biggl(\frac{1~\text{TeV}}{|\mu|}\biggr)
\biggl(\frac{\Delta m_{\text{tree}}}{100~\text{MeV}}\biggr)
F_{\text{ph}}~e\text{cm}~,
\end{align}
where $F_{\text{ph}}$ is the sum of the factors in the parentheses in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:edm}. By noting that future experiments may probe $d_e
\sim 10^{-31}~e\text{cm}$ \cite{Vutha:2009ux, Hudson:2011zz}, we 
find that a Higgsino with $\Delta m_{\text{tree}} \gtrsim 100$~MeV can
be tested in EDM experiments.  



As we have seen above, a Higgsino with $\Delta m_{\text{tree}} > {\cal
O}(100)$~MeV can be tested in future non-accelerator
experiments. On the other hand, an almost pure Higgsino with
$\Delta m_{\text{tree}}$ (much) smaller than $\sim 100$~MeV is beyond
the reach of these experiments. It is also challenging to probe such
Higgsinos in DM indirect searches, or mono-jet/$X$ searches at the LHC. 
However, as we mentioned above, in this case we may search
for Higgsinos using disappearing tracks at the LHC, since 
$\widetilde{\chi}^\pm$ becomes rather long-lived due to the
small mass difference $\Delta m_+$. The decay length of
$\widetilde{\chi}^\pm$ is approximately \cite{Chen:1995yu, *Thomas:1998wy} 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:ctau}
c\tau \simeq 0.7~\text{cm}\times \left[\left(\frac{\Delta
					m_+}{340\,\text{MeV}}\right)^3\sqrt{1
- \frac{m_\pi^2}{\Delta m_+^2}}\right]^{-1}, 
\end{eqnarray}
where $m_\pi$ is the charged pion mass. Hence, we expect that a pure charged Higgsino leaves an ${\cal
O}(1)$~cm track in the detector. We will see below that it is indeed
possible to detect an ${\cal O}(1)$~cm disappearing track at colliders.



\section{Disappearing track searches}


Disappearing track searches highly rely on the performance of silicon
pixel detectors. The CMS detector has three barrel layers of pixel
detectors in a magnetic field of 3.8~T at radii of 4.4~cm, 7.3~cm, and
10.2~cm with a pixel size of $100\times 150~\mu\text{m}^2$
\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa}\,\footnote{Recently, the CMS collaboration has replaced the pixel detectors with four layers at radii 2.9~cm, 6.8~cm, 10.9~cm and 16.0~cm \cite{Tavolaro:2016hfj}.}. The ATLAS Pixel detector is located in a
magnetic field of 2~T and consists of four barrel layers at radii of
3.3~cm, 5.05~cm, 8.85~cm, and 12.25~cm \cite{PERF-2007-01}. The
innermost layer in the ATLAS Pixel detector system called Insertable
B-Layer (IBL) \cite{Capeans:1291633}, which was installed before the LHC
Run 2 started, has a pixel size of $50\times 250~\mu\text{m}^2$, while
the other layers have a pixel size of $50\times 400~\mu\text{m}^2$. For
concreteness, we mainly consider the ATLAS setup in this section. 


The current disappearing track searches by the ATLAS
collaboration,\footnote{The CMS Run-1 study can be found in

whose main target is a long-lived charged wino, require four hits in
the silicon detectors. Thus, at the LHC Run 1, a target charged particle
needs to fly at least 29.9~cm, which corresponds to the location of the
innermost layer of the silicon strip detector called SemiConductor
Track (SCT), to pass this selection. This Run-1 analysis excludes a pure
charged wino with a mass of less than $270$~GeV \cite{Aad:2013yna}. Thanks to
the IBL, the required minimum flight length of target particles was
shorten (12.25~cm) at the Run 2, giving much better sensitivity to a
pure charged wino, which has a decay length of $\sim 6$~cm. The current
mass limit on a pure charged wino is $430$~GeV
\cite{moriond17, *moriond17conf}.

\caption{
Required number of hits in the ATLAS inner tracker for the
analyses of Run-1\&2 and ours. 
}
\label{fig:track}
\end{figure}

A similar strategy may be adopted for charged Higgsino searches. As
shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:ctau}, an almost pure charged Higgsino has a
decay length of $\sim 1$~cm, which suggests us to focus on shorter
tracks. To optimize the search strategy for this case, we here
require only two hits in the Pixel detector. In addition to these two
hits, a reconstructed primary vertex may be utilized to determine the
momentum of a disappearing track. Note that the resolution of the
position of a primary vertex is ${\cal O}(10)~\mu\text{m}$
\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-026, *moriond17DV}, which is the same order as that of the
Pixel detector. Figure~\ref{fig:track} illustrates the configuration of
the ATLAS inner tracker, where required numbers of
hits in the detector are shown by red blobs for the analyses of the
ATLAS Run-1\&2 and ours. As shown in this figure, our search
strategy allows the ATLAS detector to probe a disappearing track
with a length of $\gtrsim 5$~cm. 


According to the ATLAS Run-2 analysis \cite{moriond17, *moriond17conf}, there are three
classes of BG events in this search: hadrons that scatter
with the detector, leptons whose flight direction is bent with
Bremsstrahlung, and fake tracks due to mis-identification of hit
points. The total number of remaining BG events after the selection
cut is expected to be $11.8 \pm 3.1$ in the electroweak production
channel in the Run-2 study \cite{moriond17, *moriond17conf}. 
 
As we have reduced the number of hits in the silicon
detector, the resolution of the transverse momentum of a disappearing
track ($P^{\text{dis}}_{\text{T}}$) may be worse than the current
one, $\Delta (1/P_{\text{T}}^{\text{dis}})\sim 10~{\rm TeV}^{-1}$.
Since $\Delta (1/P_{\text{T}}^{\text{dis}}) \propto
L^{-2}$ with $L$ the track length, we expect $\Delta
(1/P_{\text{T}}^{\text{dis}})\sim 30~{\rm TeV}^{-1}$ for our two-hit
method. This means that if a disappearing track has
$P^{\text{dis}}_{\text{T}} \gtrsim 30$~GeV, its momentum can no longer
be measured accurately. This poor momentum resolution may increase the
number of BG events significantly. 

Meanwhile, these BG
events may be reduced with the help of reconstruction of displaced
tracks. This technique itself has already been established in the
long-lived particle searches with displaced vertices (DVs)
\cite{Aad:2011zb, *Aad:2012zx, *Aad:2015rba} with the current
reconstruction efficiency of displaced tracks from a radius of 5~cm
being about 80\% \cite{ATLAS:trk}. 
As the hadronic scattering and lepton Bremsstrahlung BG events
generally yield a kink signature, these events may be removed
efficiently if a DV having a disappearing
track and a displaced track is reconstructed. Notice that this requirement scarcely
reduces the signal events, since the emitted pion in the charged
Higgsino decay is too soft to be reconstructed as a kink signature. 
The fake-track events may also be resolved with the DV reconstruction,
especially those caused by displaced tracks from additional $pp$
interactions, \textit{i.e.}, pile-up events. 
Moreover, a pixel detector with a reduced pixel size of $25\times
100~\mu\text{m}^2$ is being developed \cite{Lange:2015acq}, which may improve the
momentum resolution for a disappearing track in future colliders.

Taking these potential improvements into account, in the following
analysis, we use a momentum cut of $P^{\text{dis}}_{\text{T}} > 100$~GeV
and assume that the number of BG events is not so much increased
due to deterioration in the momentum resolution.

\section{Result}

\caption{
Expected limits on Higgsino from
 disappearing track searches at the LHC and a 33~TeV collider.
}
\label{fig:higgsino}
\end{figure}

Now we discuss the prospects of our two-hit method for the long-lived
charged Higgsino searches. 
We use {\sc Madgraph5} \cite{Alwall:2014hca}, {\sc Pythia6}
\cite{Sjostrand:2006za,*Sjostrand:2007gs}, and {\sc Delphes3}
\cite{deFavereau:2013fsa} for collider simulations and estimate the
production cross sections of SUSY particles with {\sc Prospino2}
\cite{Beenakker:1996ed}. 
We consider the 8~TeV LHC with
$20.3$~fb$^{-1}$ data \cite{Aad:2013yna}, the 13~TeV run with
$36.1$~fb$^{-1}$ data \cite{moriond17, *moriond17conf}, and the 14-TeV LHC and a future
33~TeV run with an integrated luminosity of $3$~ab$^{-1}$. We adopt the
same set of kinematic selection criteria as in the Run-1 analysis
\cite{Aad:2013yna}, except for the missing energy cut,
$E^{\text{miss}}_{\text{T}} > 140$~GeV, and the leading-jet transverse
momentum cut, $P^{\text{lead}}_{\text{T}} > 140$~GeV for the 8 and
13~TeV cases. For the 14 and 33 TeV cases, we require
$E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}, P^{\text{lead}}_{\text{T}} > 400$~GeV and
600~GeV, respectively. As mentioned above, for the selection of disappearing
track candidates, we require two hits in the silicon tracker with
$P^{\text{dis}}_{\text{T}} > 100$~GeV. To estimate the number of
BG events for each case, we rescale the observed number of
BG events in the ATLAS Run-2 study \cite{moriond17, *moriond17conf} according to
the event rates of the $W+\text{jets}$ and $t\bar{t}$ processes. We find
that the expected number of BG events is $\sim 10$ for these
cases. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsino}, we show the expected limits from the 8~TeV,
13~TeV, 14~TeV, and 33~TeV searches in the yellow dot-dashed line, the blue
dashed line, the green dashed band, and the red bands, respectively. For the
33~TeV run, we assume that the second layer of a pixel detector is
located at a radius of 5 and 3~cm for the upper and lower bands,
respectively. The upper (lower) line of each band corresponds to ten
(zero) BG events. The systematic error in BG expectation is assumed to be $10~\%$. In addition, we show the decay lengths of Higgsino with
$\Delta m_{\text{tree}} = 0$, 75, and 150~MeV in black dotted lines
from top to bottom. The vertical blue stripe at $\sim 1.1$~TeV indicates the
favored mass value for pure Higgsino DM in terms of thermal
relic abundance \cite{Cirelli:2007xd}. This figure shows that the Run-2
data already have a sensitivity to pure Higgsino. The reach of the
high-luminosity LHC is expected to be 500--600 GeV. Moreover, a future
33~TeV $pp$ collider may probe pure Higgsino with a mass of $\gtrsim
1$~TeV, with which we can test the pure Higgsino DM scenario. 



\begin{figure}
{\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{wino.pdf}} 
\caption{
The current \cite{Aad:2013yna, moriond17, *moriond17conf} and expected limits on wino
 at the LHC and a 33~TeV collider. 
}
\label{fig:wino}
\end{figure}

Our two-hit search strategy can also extend the reach of charged wino
searches. To see this, we perform a similar analysis for the wino LSP
and show the results in Fig.~\ref{fig:wino}. The colors and types of the
lines and stripes are the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:higgsino}.
The 8~TeV and 13~TeV limits in this figure are taken from
Refs.~\cite{Aad:2013yna, moriond17, *moriond17conf}. It is found that the reach of the
high-luminosity LHC for a pure wino can exceed 1~TeV. A future 33~TeV
collider may probe a pure wino with a mass of $\gtrsim 2.5$~TeV, where
(the most of) the observed DM density is explained by the
thermal relic abundance of the wino LSP \cite{Hisano:2006nn}. 

Finally, we note in passing that our two-hit search may probe Higgsino
and wino up to 1.7~TeV and 4~TeV or even larger, respectively, at a
100~TeV collider with an integrated luminosity of 3~ab$^{-1}$.


\section{Conclusion and discussion}

In this letter, we have discussed the testability of the Higgsino DM
scenario. We have seen that a wide region of parameter space for the
Higgsino DM scenario can be probed in future non-accelerator
experiments. However, if the electroweak-inos are so heavy that the
tree-level charged-neutral Higgsino mass difference is less than ${\cal
O}(100)$~MeV, Higgsinos may escape from these non-accelerator
searches. To probe such cases, in this paper, we propose a new collider
search strategy for almost pure Higgsinos based on the first two layers
of the Pixel detector, which is sensitive to ${\cal O}(1)$~cm disappearing
tracks. We have found that using this two-hit search method we can probe
1~TeV pure Higgsino, whose thermal relic abundance agrees with
$\Omega_{\text{DM}} h^2 \simeq 0.12$, at a 33~TeV collider. As a
consequence, the non-accelerator experiments and the disappearing track
searches play a complementary role in probing Higgsinos, and thus the
interplay among these experiments is of great importance to test the
Higgsino DM scenario experimentally. 

This method can also improve the disappearing track searches for
long-lived charged winos. In fact, since pure charged winos have
relatively long decay length, $\sim 6$~cm, we expect a number of signal
events with the two-hit search strategy. In this case, we may even
require two disappearing tracks, which can reduce the SM BG
significantly. We also note that this two-hit strategy is useful
for the search of other electroweak-charged DM candidates. A detailed study
of these searches, as well as the reduction of BG by means of DVs, will
be discussed elsewhere \cite{FNOS}. 

As we have seen, our proposal for the detection of disappearing tracks 
extends the LHC reach of the Higgsino and wino DM searches significantly.
Nonetheless, the mass values favored by thermal relic are beyond the 
LHC reach, and thus we need a new hadron collider to cover the entire region 
for the DM scenario. It is worth emphasizing that to maximize the potential 
of such a collider, not only an increase in the beam energy and luminosity,
but also an improvement in the tracker system is of crucial importance, 
which should be considered seriously when we discuss proposals for future colliders.

{\it Note Added:} 
During the completion of this paper, a related study
\cite{Mahbubani:2017gjh} was submitted to arXiv where pure Higgsino
searches based on disappearing tracks at the LHC and a future 100~TeV
collider were discussed on the assumption that a charged track with a
length of 10~cm is detectable. We also noticed that the ATLAS
collaboration started to study a possibility of using a
two-hit strategy to search for long-lived charged winos \cite{jps17}.

"\section{Introduction}
The 
Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity is motivated by a deformation of the usual energy-momentum dispersion 
relation in the UV limit
\cite{hovrava2009quantum,hovrava2009spectral}. Another UV modification of general relativity also 
motivated by a deformation of the usual energy-momentum dispersion 
relation in the UV limit is the 
gravity's rainbow \cite{magueijo2002lorentz}.  It is interesting to note that  the 
deformation  of the usual energy-momentum dispersion in the UV limit  occurs 
in various approaches to quantum gravity such as   discrete spacetime
\cite{tHooft:1996ziz}, models based on string field theory \cite{Kostelecky:1988zi}, spacetime
foam \cite{amelino1998tests}, spin-network in loop quantum gravity (LQG)
\cite{Gambini:1998it} and non-commutative geometry \cite{carroll2001noncommutative}. 
The formalism  has been used to study various geometries motivated from string theory. 
In fact, the different Lifshitz scaling of space and time has been used to deform 
type IIA string theory \cite{gregory2010lifshitz}, type  IIB string theory \cite{Burda:2014jca},   AdS/CFT correspondence 
\cite{Gubser:2009cg, Ong:2011km, Alishahiha:2012iy,  dey2015interpolating},  dilaton black branes 
\cite{Goldstein:2010aw, bertoldi2009thermodynamics},cylindrical solutions \cite{Momeni:2017cvl} and dilaton black holes \cite{Zangeneh:2015uwa, Tarrio:2011de} and .
Gravity's rainbow is a more general theory that is
 motivated by deformation of the energy-momentum 
dispersion relation, similar to what motivates  Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. Hence both approaches are connected to same quantum gravity phenomenology. In fact, for a particular choice of rainbow functions, gravity's rainbow seem's to agree with  Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity.
 As  what has been shown in \cite{Garattini:2014rwa}. 
The Lifshitz deformation of geometries has produced interesting results, 
and rainbow deformation has the same motivation, 
in this paper we will study the rainbow deformation 
of BTZ black holes.


In gravity's rainbow, the geometry depends on 
the energy of the  probe, and thus  probes of 
of different energy see the geometry  differently.
Thus,  a single metric is replaced  by a family of energy
dependent metrics forming a rainbow of metrics. Now the 
UV modification of the energy-momentum dispersion relation  can be expressed as 
\begin{equation}  \label{MDR}
E^2f^2(E/E_P)-p^2g^2(E/E_P)=m^2
\end{equation}
where $E_P$ is the Planck energy, $E$ is the energy at which the geometry 
is probed, and  $f(E/E_P)$ and $g(E/E_P)$
are the  rainbow functions. As the general relativity should be recovered 
in the IR limit, we have 
\begin{equation}
\lim\limits_{E/E_P\to0} f(E/E_P)=1,\qquad \lim\limits_{E/E_P\to0} g(E/E_P)=1.
\label{rainbowfunctions}
\end{equation}
Now the metric in gravity's rainbow \cite{magueijo2004gravity}
\begin{equation}  \label{rainmetric}
h(E)=\eta^{ab}e_a(E)\otimes e_b(E).
\end{equation}
So, the energy dependent   frame fields  are 
\begin{equation}
e_0(E)=\frac{1}{f(E/E_P)}\tilde{e}_0, \qquad e_i(E)=\frac{1}{g(E/E_P)}\tilde{%
	e}_i. 
\end{equation}
Here $\tilde{e}_0 $ and $ \tilde{e}_i$ are the original energy independent frame fields. 

The rainbow deformation of geometry motivated from string theory,
such as black rings \cite{Ali:2014yea}, and 
black branes \cite{ashour2016branes} has been studied. The rainbow deformation 
of higher dimensional black holes has important consequences 
for the detection of black holes at the LHC \cite{Ali:2014qra}. 
The rainbow deformation of modified theories of gravity, and 
of gravity coupled to non-linear  sources has been studied \cite{Hendi:2016dmh,hendi2016charged, Hendi:2015hja, hendi2016charged, hendi2016charged, Rudra:2016alu,Hendi:2017pld,  Garattini:2012ec}. 
The gravity's rainbow has also been used to address the information paradox in black holes 
\cite{Ali:2014cpa, Gim:gim2015black,ali2015gravitational}. It may be noted that general properties of energy dependent 
metric for a BTZ black hole, and its coupling to non-linear sources has been discussed 
using gravity rainbow \cite{hendi2016asymptotically}. In this paper, we analyse the thermodynamic aspects 
of such a deformation explicitly.  We are able to show that even though many  thermodynamic 
quantities of a  BTZ black hole are deformed by gravity's rainbow, the Gibbs free energy is not 
deformed. Thus, the critical phenomena based on Gibbs free energy is not deformed by gravity's rainbow. 
\section{BTZ Black holes}
In 2+1 dimensions, Einstein field equations with negative cosmological constant (AdS spacetime) admit - in addition to the vacuum solution- a two-parameter family of black hole solutions found by Banados, Teitelboim and Zanelli \cite{banados1992black}, given by the metric, without charge,\footnote{Planckian units is used throughout the manuscript $ k_b=c=G=\hbar =1$}
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -N^2 dt^2 +N^{-2} dr^2 + r^2 \left( d \phi+ N^\phi dt\right) ^2.
\label{BTZmetric}
\end{equation}
Where the functions $ N^2 = \frac{(r^2 - r_+^2)(r^2 - r_-^2)}{b^2 r^2}$ and $ (N^\phi)^2 = \frac{r_+ r_-}{b r^2}$. With $ b$ is the radius of AdS and $r_{\pm}$ is obtained when the lapse function $N$ vanishes (indicating the outer and inner horizons, respectively),
\begin{equation}
r_{\pm} = \left[  b^2 \, \frac{M}{2}\left( 1\pm \sqrt{1- \frac{J^2}{b^2 M^2}}\right) \right] ^{1/2},
	\label{horizon}
\end{equation}
with $M$ and $J$ being the mass and angular momentum of the BTZ black hole respectively. They can be therefore defined in terms of $ b, r{\pm}$ accordingly:
\begin{align}
M&= \frac{r^2_+r^2_-}{b^2}, & J&= \frac{2r_+r_-}{b}.
\label{MJ}
\end{align}
In order to study the thermodynamics of BTZ black hole we first write the first law of black hole mechanics \cite{smarr1973mass}
\begin{equation}
dM= TdS+ Jd\Omega.
\label{loi1er}
\end{equation}
The angular speed  $ \Omega $ is calculated from $ g_{tt}/g_{\phi \phi}$
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \frac{J}{b^2 M}.
\label{omega}
\end{equation}
The temperature $T_0$ is calculating for the surface curvature, with the killing vector $ K = \partial_t + \Omega \partial_\phi$, \cite{birmingham2001exact,cruz2004thermal}
\begin{equation}
T_0= \frac{r^2_+-r^2_-}{2 \pi r_+}.
\label{temp0}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\label{tzero}
\end{figure}
The expression \eqref{temp0} indicates an extremal limit when $ M< \b J$.  We observe that the temperature of BTZ black holes show a similar thermodynamic behaviour to their higher dimensional analogues figure \ref{tzero}. Now we use \eqref{loi1er} and \eqref{MJ} to calculate the entropy
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[scale= 0.6]{szero}

\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
S_0= 4 \pi r_+ ,
\label{entropy}
\end{equation}
which is, as expected,  the forth of the horizon area `circumference'. Complying with the Bekenstein formula. We can also calculate the constant $J$ heat capacity $ C_J$ :
\begin{equation}
C_J = T\left(  \frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right) _J = \frac{4 \pi r_+}{2-\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}}\,\left[ \frac{1+\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2 }{2}\right] ^ {1/2}
\label{cj}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the heat capacity at constant angular velocity $C_\Omega$ is calculated,
\begin{equation}
C_\Omega = 4 \pi b \left[ \frac{M}{2}\,\left( 1+\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}\right) \right] ^ {1/2}.
\label{comega}
\end{equation}

	\label{capacity}
\end{figure}
We wish also to investigate the thermodynamic pressure - volume relation for BTZ black holes and the associated critical phenomena.  We define the ` volume' of BTZ black hole by the relation \cite{altamirano2014thermodynamics}, which is approximately the thermodynamic volume for slow rotating black holes $ J \ll1$.  
\begin{equation}
V_0= A r_+ = 16 \pi r_+^2
\label{volume}
\end{equation}
  Now, we consider the thermodynamic pressure of BTZ black hole from the Van der Wall's fluid equation of state in the extended phase space \cite{kubizvnak2012p}. 
  \begin{equation}
  P_0 := \frac{T}{v} +\mathcal{O}(J^2),
  \label{pressure}
  \end{equation}
with :
\begin{equation}
v= 2 \left( \frac{V}{\pi}\right) ^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
We observe from the PV diagram  that BTZ black holes admit the same critical phenomena as the higher dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes for some critical temperature $ T_c$ \cite{Frassino:2014pha}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale= 0.6]{PV}

	\label{pv}
\end{figure}
BTZ black holes show an interesting thermodynamic properties. In the next section, they shall be studied after gravity rainbow deformation on the BTZ  metric. 
\section{BTZ black holes in gravity's rainbow}
In this section, we will deform the thermodynamics of a BTZ black hole by 
the gravity's rainbow. Now here 
$E$ is the   energy  of a 
quantum particle near the event horizon of the BTZ black hole.   This particle is  emitted from the black hole 
due to the Hawking radiation, the energy of the particle is associated with the black hole temperature $T$
\cite{ali2014black}. In fact, in the geometric units used in the paper $ k_B=1$, the black hole temperature is the same as the energy of the radiated particle, i.e $T_{BH} = E$. 
We can use the 
uncertainty principle, and write $\Delta p \geq 1/\Delta x $. Thus, we can obtain   a bound
on energy of a black hole, $E \geq 1/\Delta x $ \cite{ali2015remnant}.
This can be done for any black hole, including a BTZ black hole. It may be noted that the 
usual uncertainty principle is valid in gravity's rainbow \cite{ali2014black}.  So, 
the uncertainty in position of the particle
near the horizon of the BTZ black hole is equal to the of the 
event horizon,
\begin{equation}
E\geq 1/{\Delta x} \approx 1/{r_+}.
\end{equation}
It is important to noted from this that the energy used to deform the thermodynamics is a 
dynamical function of the radial
coordinate \cite{Garattini:2014rwa} 
The general relation for temperature of a black hole in gravity rainbow was found to be \cite{ali2015remnant} :
\begin{equation}
T= T_0 \frac{g(E)}{f(E)}
\label{Trainbow}
\end{equation}
Where $f(E)$ and $ g(E)$ are the rainbow function defined in \eqref{rainbowfunctions}. This conjecture is explained and proved in the following references \cite{ali2015gravitational,ali2015remnant,angheben2005hawking,ali2014black} and many others. We may also show that the formula \eqref{Trainbow} applies for BTZ black holes in gravity rainbow as well. \\
First, consider the modification of the metric \eqref{BTZmetric} by the gravity rainbow functions \cite{hendi2016asymptotically,ma2008hawking,ali2015gravitational}:
\begin{equation}
ds^2 = -\frac{N^2}{f^2(E)} dt^2 +g^{-2}(E)N^{-2} dr^2 + g^{-2}(E) r^2 \left( d \phi+ N^\phi dt\right) ^2.
\label{BTZrainbowmetric}
\end{equation}
An the modified temperature is given by the generic formula \cite{wald2010general}:
\begin{equation}
T = \frac{1}{4 \pi}\sqrt{\partial_r( A(r,0)) B(r,0)}
	\label{genericT}
\end{equation} 
Where $ A(r) = \frac{N^2}{f^2(E)}$ and $ B(r) = g^{-2}(E)N^{-2}$.  Therefore, we arrive at the formula for temperature in gravity rainbow \eqref{Trainbow}. \\
The are many ways in witch we can define the rainbow functions $ f(E), g(E)$. Motivated by many theoretical  \cite{garattini2014electric,awad2013nonsingular,majumder2013singularity}. And experimental \cite{amelino1998tests} approaches.  The choice of these functions in this paper is the one motivated by loop quantum gravity and non-commutative geometry \cite{amelino2013quantum,jacob2010modifications}.
\begin{align}
 f(E) &:= 1 & g(E) &:= \sqrt{1-\eta(E/E_p)^ \nu},
\label{rainbowfunctions1}
\end{align}
for $ \eta $ and $ \nu$ being free parameters.
Now, we use \eqref{Trainbow}\eqref{temp0}, and \eqref{rainbowfunctions1} to obtain the modified BTZ temperature :
\begin{equation}
T= \frac{r^2_+-r^2_-}{2 \pi r_+} \sqrt{1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu}
\label{temprainbow}
\end{equation}

In order to calculate the modified entropy, we use the first law $ dM= T dS$. With \eqref{MJ}, and \eqref{entropy} we get :
\begin{align}
S= \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{r_+}{g(E)}= \frac{\pi r_+}{2\sqrt{1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu}}
\label{entropy_rainbow}
\end{align}
It is interesting to look at the graphs between  $ S_0$ and $r_+$, and between $S$ and $r_+$\ref{s_rainbow} . Observing that the entropy of rainbow gravity modified BTZ black holes will diminish at some point with $ r_+ \neq 0$ , indicating the existence of remnant. This effect is observed in higher dimensional Kerr-AdS black holes in rainbow gravity \cite{ali2015remnant}.
\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[scale= 0.6]{entropyr}
	\caption{A plot of  BTZ entropy  $S_0$ in blue. And the deformed entropy $S$ in yellow (For $ E_p=5$, $ \eta =1$ and $ \nu=1$), both as a function of $r_+$. The latter indicates the existence of remnant of radius $\frac{1}{5}$ Planck units.   }
	\label{s_rainbow}
\end{figure}
Since the entropy of a black hole is related to its area ( circumference in 2+1 dimensions). Moreover, the 2+1 dimensional gravity is a topological theory, one might relate the remnant of rainbow BTZ black hole as a topological defect associated with the minimal length of the 2+1 gravity theory \cite{vilenkin2000cosmic,carlip19952+}. The radius of this topological defect is given by:
\begin{equation}
r_{min} = \frac{\eta^{1/\nu} }{E_p} \sim \ell_p
\end{equation}
Which could be the minimal length of the 2+1 gravity rainbow. 
Now we calculate the  modified heat capacities , observe that $\left(  \frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right) _J$ and $\left(  \frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\right) _\Omega$, do not change by the gravity rainbow modifications. Hence the heat capacities are easily computed 
\begin{align}
C_J =& \sqrt{1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu}\left[  \frac{4 \pi r_+}{2-\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}}\right] \,\left[ \frac{1+\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2 }{2}\right] ^ {1/2}
\label{cj_rainbow} \\
C_\Omega =&  4 \pi b \sqrt{1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu} \left[ \frac{M}{2}\,\left( 1+\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}\right) \right] ^ {1/2}.
\label{comega_rainbow}
\end{align}
The volume of the modified BTZ is given from \eqref{volume}:
\begin{equation}
V= \frac{2 \pi r^2_+}{\sqrt{1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu}}\label{v_rainbow}
\end{equation}
Moreover, the modified  pressure is written as:
\begin{equation}
P= \frac{1}{2}\left( 1-\eta(1/r_+E_p)^ \nu\right) ^{1/4} P_0
\end{equation}
The P-V criticality of rainbow BTZ is not different from the ordinary BTZ black hole. This also can be seen from calculating the Gibbs free energy of ordinary and rainbow BTZ black hole,  The  Gibbs free energy, $G$ given by the thermodynamic relation:
\begin{equation}
G(T) = M+PV-TS.
\end{equation}
For an ordinary BTZ black holes it can be calculated using \eqref{MJ}\eqref{entropy} and \eqref{omega}. 
\begin{align}
G_0( T, \Omega )=& M-TS-\Omega J = -\frac{\pi ^2 b ^2 }{6\sqrt{1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2}}\\ \nonumber \times \qquad& \left( T^2 + \sqrt{\frac{2 \pi}{b}(1-\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2 )}T +\frac{1}{4 \pi^2 b^2} \, \left[  2+\left( \frac{J}{b M}\right) ^2 \right]  \right) \left( \frac{1}{b \Omega}\right) 
\end{align}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale= 0.6]{Gibbs}
	\caption{A plot of $G(T, \Omega)$ of a  BTZ black hole $ T>T_c$ with $b=0.5$. Showing the critical phenomena.}
	\label{Gibbs}
\end{figure}
We may conclude that $ G>0$  for critical BTZ black holes and $ G<0$ for non critical ones  \\ The Gibbs free energy for a rainbow BTZ is calculating using the same relation but, substituting $T_0$ and $S_0$ with $T$ in \eqref{Trainbow} and $S$ in \eqref{entropy_rainbow}. Since the rainbow function $ g(E)$ appear in $T$ and its reciprocal appears in $S$.  $G$ for the rainbow BTZ black hole is the same as $G_0$. Indicating the same critical phenomena. 
\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have deformed the geometry  of a BTZ black hole by rainbow 
functions. Thus, the thermodynamics of the BTZ black was also deformed 
by these rainbow functions. The rainbow functions that were used for this deformation 
have been    motivated from results 
in loop quantum gravity and Noncommutative geometry. It was   observed that the thermodynamics 
of the BTZ black hole got  deformed due to these rainbow functions. The graphs of the deformed entropy $S$ and temperature $T$ indicate the existence of a remnant at the last stage of evaporation, similar to the higher dimensional deformed black holes.
However, the Gibbs free energy did  
not get deformed,  and so the critical behaviour from Gibbs 
did not change by this deformation. Thus, the critical behaviour of BTZ black holes in gravity's 
rainbow was the same the  critical behaviour of BTZ black hole in ordinary gravity. This is apparent because the temperature is deformed in an opposite way to the entropy, causing both deformations to cancel out in the Gibb's free energy.

"\section{Introduction}

\par X-ray binaries are systems in which a black hole or neutron star accretes matter from a stellar companion, and they provide us with opportunities to test how accretion takes place in the most extreme physical regimes.  Some X-ray Binaries are believed to be accreting at very close to the Eddington limit, the limit at which the radiation pressure on accreting material is equal to the force due to gravity.  As such, these objects can also provide a laboratory with which to explore accretion in radiation pressure-dominated systems \citep{White_Radiation}.
\par Low Mass X-ray Binaries (hereafter LMXBs) are a subclass of X-ray binary in which the compact object accretes matter transferred to it due to a Roche-lobe overflow from the companion star (e.g. \citealp{Paczynski_Roche}).  In general, accretion in LMXBs is a variable process, with variability seen on timescales from milliseconds to decades.  On the shortest timescales the X-ray lightcurves of these objects can show band-limited noise and low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) at frequencies from $\sim$mHz to $\sim$200\,Hz (e.g. \citealp{vanderKlis_QPOs}).  Black hole binaries also show so-called `high frequency QPOs' (e.g. \citealp{Remillard_HHz1,Remillard_HHz2,Belloni_QPOs,Belloni_Review}),  thought to be caused by motion of matter in the innermost region of the accretion disk (e.g. \citealp{Stefanov_HFQPOs}).
\par Three sources -- GRS 1915+105, IGR J17091-3624 and the neutron star `Rapid Burster' (MXB 1730-335) -- also show a variety of exotic variability on timescales of seconds to minutes in addition to the kinds of variability seen in other LMXBs.  This exotic variability consists of quasi-periodic flares, dips and other high-amplitude behaviours (e.g \citealp{Belloni_GRS_MI,Altamirano_IGR_FH,Bagnoli_RB}).  The second-to-minute-scale lightcurve profiles of these sources change over timescales of days.  In GRS 1915+105 and IGR J17091-3624, this behaviour can be described as a set of `variability classes'.  These classes themselves vary widely in terms of flux, structure, periodicity and spectral properties.
\par  GRS 1915+105 \citep{CastroTirado_GRS1915}, hereafter GRS 1915, is a black hole LMXB which accretes at between a few tens and 100\% of its Eddington Limit (e.g. \citealp{Vilhu_SupEd,Done_GRS_HighAcc,Fender_DiskJet,Reid_Parallax}).  Most LMXBs go through periods of low-intensity `quiescence' and high-intensity `outbursts', the latter consisting of black-body dominated `soft' and power-law dominated `hard' spectral states.  However, GRS 1915 has been in outburst since its discovery in 1992 \citep{CastroTirado_GRS1915}.  GRS 1915 is also notable for the incredible variety and complexity of variability classes it exhibits (e.g. \citealp{Yadav_GRSBursts,Belloni_GRS_MI}) in addition to the less exotic variability seen in other black hole binary systems.  GRS 1915 additionally shows high-frequency and low frequency QPOs similar to those seen in other black hole LMXBs \citep{Morgan_QPO}.  In total, 15 distinct variability classes have been observed \citep{Belloni_GRS_MI,KleinWolt_OmegaClass,Hannikainen_NewClass, Pahari_NewClass}.  This remarkable range of behaviour is believed to be caused by instability in the inner accretion disc (e.g. \citealp{Janiuk_RadInstab,Nayakshin_GRSModel}), which is in turn caused by the existence of a radiation pressure dominated regime in the inner disc (e.g. \citealp{Done_GRS_HighAcc}).   Accounting for this complexity could be key to our understanding of radiation-dominated accretion regimes.
\par One of the best-studied variability classes of GRS 1915 is the highly regular flaring $\rho$, or `heartbeat', class, so named for the similarity of its lightcurve to an electrocardiogram. It has been shown that hard X-ray photons tend to lag soft ones in this class (e.g. \citealp{Janiuk_Lag,Massaro_Lag}).  Numerical models derived from \citealp{Shakura_Disk} which reproduce this lag can also reproduce other flaring classes seen in GRS 1915 (e.g \citealp{Nayakshin_GRSModel,Massaro_Numerical}).  These numerical models predict that GRS 1915-like variability should be seen in systems accreting with a global Eddington fraction of $\gtrsim0.26$ \citep{Nayakshin_GRSModel}.  However, other LMXBs (e.g. GX 17+2, \citealp{Kuulkers_GX17}, and V404 Cyg, \citealp{Huppenkothen_V404}) have been observed to exceed this Eddington fraction without displaying GRS 1915-like variability.
\par \citet{Neilsen_GRSModel} proposed a physical scenario, based on the mathematical model proposed by \citet{Nayakshin_GRSModel}, to explain the presence of the hard lag in the flaring classes of GRS 1915.  This is outlined schematically in Figure \ref{fig:WindsModel}.  First, an overdensity of matter forms via the thermal-viscous Lightman-Eardley Instability \citep{Lightman_Instability} and propagates inwards through the accretion disc.  This destabilises the disc, collapsing its inner radius and vastly increasing photon emission.  If the local Eddington Limit in the inner accretion disc is then approached, extreme outflows are triggered that deplete the inner accretion disc and allow the cycle to begin again.  As the matter ejected from the disc collides with the non-thermal `corona' above the central object, a flash of hard Bremsstrahlung radiation is produced.  This causes a hardening of the spectrum and an apparent lag between soft and hard photons.  \citet{Janiuk_Lag} instead propose that the lag is caused by the corona smoothly adjusting to the changing brightness of the disc after a light travel time.

  \caption{\small A schematic diagram illustrating the the process described by \citet{Neilsen_GRSModel} to describe the $\rho$ variability class in GRS 1915+105.  1) The X-ray emission from the system originates from both the accretion disc truncated at an inner radius $r_{in}$ (grey) and a cloud of non-thermal electrons (white ellipse).  At some time $t$, an overdensity in the accretion disc (formed by the Lightman-Eardley Instability) propagates inwards towards $r_{in}$.  2) As the inner disc heats up, $r_{in}$ begins to slowly increase due to an increase in photon pressure.  This destabilises the disc.  3) At some critical density, the disc becomes too unstable and collapses inwards, greatly decreasing $r_{in}$ and raising the inner disc temperature.  4) The sudden increase in emission exceeds the local Eddington limit at $r_{in}$, ejecting matter from the inner accretion disc in the form of extreme winds.  5) Having been excited by matter in the winds passing through it, the non-thermal electron cloud emits a hard Brehmsstrahlung `pulse'.}

\par The black hole candidate LMXB IGR J17091-3624 (hereafter J17091) was discovered in outburst by \textit{INTEGRAL} in 2003 \citep{Kuulkers_IGRDiscovery}.  In 2011, it again went into outburst \citep{Krimm_IGROutburst}.  GRS 1915-like variability was discovered in its lightcurve, as well as high-frequency QPOs which behave much like the QPOs seen in GRS 1915 \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH,Altamirano_Discovery,Altamirano_HFQPO}.  As IGR J17091 is around a factor of 20 fainter at 2--25\,keV than GRS 1915, this object has either a lower black hole mass $M$, a lower accretion rate $\dot{m}$ or lies at a larger distance $D$ than GRS 1915.  Assuming by analogy with GRS 1915 that IGR J17091 is accreting at its Eddington rate, the black hole must have a mass of $M\lesssim3$M$_\odot$\ or lie at a distance of $D\gtrsim20$ kpc \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH}.  However, independent estimates based on empirical relationships between black hole mass and high-frequency QPOs have suggested values of $M$ between $\sim8.7$ and $15.6$ M$_\odot$\ \citep{Rebusco_IGRMass,Iyer_Bayes,Iyer_IGRMass}, while multi-wavelength observations of the hard-to-soft state transition have suggested values of $D$ between $\sim$11 and $\sim$17 kpc \citep{Rodriguez_D}.  This implies that IGR J17091 may have an accretion rate $\dot{m}$ that is significantly below its Eddington rate.
\par The suggestion that IGR J17091 accretes at significantly below the Eddington Limit raises several questions.  Despite evidence of disc winds in IGR J17091 faster than 0.03c \citep{King_IGRWinds}, the wind generation procedure described in \citet{Neilsen_GRSModel} cannot take place without near-Eddington-limited accretion.   Additionally, it makes it increasingly unclear what differentiates IGR J17091 and GRS 1915 from the vast majority of LMXBs which do not display such complex behaviour, and what physical system properties are required for GRS 1915-like variability to be observed.  This latter point was further complicated by the observation of GRS 1915-like variability in 2 out of 155 \textit{RXTE}\ observations of the Rapid Burster \citep{Bagnoli_RB}.  As thermonuclear (Type I) X-ray bursts are also seen in the Rapid Burster \citep{Hoffman_RB}, it is known to contain a neutron star.  As such, the presence of variability classes in this object rules out any black hole-specific effects as the cause of the complex variability.  In addition to this, the persistent luminosity of the Rapid Burster during periods of GRS 1915-like variability is known to be no greater than $\sim10\%$ of its Eddington limit \citep{Bagnoli_PopStudy}.
\par Accounting for GRS 1915-like variability is required for a complete understanding of the physics of accretion in LMXBs.  As such, \citet{Belloni_GRS_MI} performed a complete model-independent analysis of variability classes in GRS 1915.  This work highlighted the breadth and diversity of variability in GRS 1915, and allowed these authors to search for features common to all variability classes.  For example, \citet{Belloni_GRS_MI} also found that every variability class can be expressed as a pattern of transitions between three quasi-stable phenomenological states.
\par Previous works have noted that some of the variability classes seen in IGR J17091-3624 appear very similar to those seen in GRS 1915 (e.g. \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH, Zhang_IGR}).  However, although $\rho$-like classes in the two objects both show lags between hard and soft X-rays photons, these lags appear to possess different signs \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH}.  Additionally, at least two variability classes have been reported in IGR J17091 which have not yet been reported in GRS 1915 \citep{Pahari_IGRClasses}.  Previous works have described some of the behaviour seen in IGR J17091 in the context of the variability classes described by \citealt{Belloni_GRS_MI} for GRS 1915 (e.g. \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH,Pahari_RhoDiff}).  To further explore the comparison between GRS 1915 and IGR J17091, here we perform the first comprehensive model-independent analysis of variability classes in IGR J17091 using the complete set of \textit{RXTE}\ \citep{Bradt_RXTE} data taken of the 2011-2013 outburst of the object.  We also use data from all other X-ray missions that observed the source during this time to analyse the long-term evolution of the outburst.

\section{Data and Data Analysis}

\label{sec:dex}

\par In this paper, we report data from \textit{RXTE} , \textit{INTEGRAL}, \textit{Swift}, \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Suzaku} covering the 2011-2013 outburst of IGR J17091.  Unless stated otherwise, all errors are quoted at the 1$\sigma$ level.
\par In Figure \ref{fig:allmissions} we present long-term lightcurves from \textit{RXTE} ,  \textit{INTEGRAL} and \textit{Swift} with one datapoint per observation, as well as indicating when during the outburst \textit{Chandra}, \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Suzaku} observations were made.

\begin{figure*}

    \caption{\textit{RXTE}\ (Panel a), \textit{Swift/XRT} (Panel b), \textit{Swift/BAT} (Panel b) and \textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS (Panel d) lightcurves of IGR J17091-3624 during its 2011-2013 outburst.  Arrows mark times at which \textit{XMM-Newton} (blue), \textit{Chandra} (red) or \textit{Suzaku} (magenta) observed IGR J17091-3624.  The cyan line represents MJD 55963, the approximate time IGR J17091-3624 transitions from the soft to the hard state \citep{Drave_Return}.  \textit{RXTE} \textit{/PCA} \citep{Jahoda_PCA} data are for the 2--16\,keV energy band and taken from \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH}, \textit{Swift/BAT} \citep{Barthelmy_BAT} data are for 15--50\,keV, \textit{Swift/XRT} \citep{Burrows_XRT}  data are for 0.3--10\,keV and \textit{INTEGRAL/ISGRI} \citep{Ubertini_IBIS} data are for 20-40\,keV.  Note that the data from \textit{Swift/XRT} (Panel B) are shown with a logarithmic $y$-axis to better show the late time progression of the outburst.  Data points are coloured according to the observing mode used.  The \textit{Swift/XRT} data from times later than MJD 56422 are shown to a different scale to better represent the post-outburst evolution of the source.  All data are presented in 1 day bins, except for data from \textit{Swift/BAT} which is presented in 4 day bins.  See also Figure \ref{fig:WhereCls}, in which data from \textit{RXTE} \textit{/PCA} is presented on a smaller scale.  The Crab count rates used to normalise these data were 2300 cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$, 747.5 cts s$^{-1}$, 0.214 cts s$^{-1}$ and 183.5 cts s$^{-1}$ for \textit{RXTE} , \textit{Swift/XRT}, \textit{Swift/BAT} and \textit{INTEGRAL/ISGRI} respectively.  \textit{RXTE}\ data have not been corrected for the 25' offset to avoid contamination from GX 349+2, and for all instruments we implicitly assume that IGR J17091 presents a Crab-like spectrum.}

\subsection{\textit{RXTE}}

\label{sec:XTEDA}

\par For our variability study, we focus on the data from the Proportional Counter Array (\textit{PCA}, \citealp{Jahoda_PCA}) aboard the Rossi X-Ray Riming Experiment (\textit{RXTE} , \citealp{Bradt_RXTE}).  We analysed all 2011 \textit{PCA} observations of IGR J17091, corresponding to OBSIDs 96065-03, 96103-01 and 96420-01.  The observations taken for proposals 96065-03 and 96103-01 were contaminated by the nearby X-ray source GX 349+2 \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH,Rodriguez_Contamination}.  As such we only use observations performed for proposal 96420-01, corresponding to a total of 243 orbits from 215 separate observations.  These were offset by 25' such that GX 349+2 was not in the $1^\circ$ \textit{PCA} field of view.  \textit{RXTE}\ was decommissioned during a period of Sun constraint centred on MJD 55907,  and hence the last observation of IGR J17091 was taken on MJD 55879.
\par We extracted data from the native \texttt{FITS} format using our own software\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jmcourt/pantheon}}.  To perform medium- to high-frequency ($\gtrsim1$\,Hz) timing analysis, we merged files formatted in \textit{PCA}\ 's `Good Xenon' data mode and extracted their data at the maximum time resolution ($\sim9.5\times10^{-7}$ s) without accounting for the background.  We divided these data into 128\,s segments as this allowed us to reach frequencies below $\sim0.015$\,Hz, partly sampling the high amplitude quasi-periodic flaring behaviour seen in many classes.  Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), we produced the power spectrum of each segment separately.  We then averaged these spectra to create a one co-added Power Density Spectrum (PDS) for each observation.
\par For low-frequency ($\leq1$\,Hz) timing and correlated spectral/timing analysis, we rebinned the data to 0.5\,s and normalised count rates by the number of proportional counters (PCUs) active in each observation.  Our choice of 1\,Hz allows us to analyse high amplitude `flaring' behaviour (seen at frequencies $\lesssim0.5$\,Hz) separately from the lower-amplitude behaviour seen at $\gtrsim5$\,Hz.
\par We split the data into three energy bands: A (\textit{PCA} channels 0--14, $\sim2$--$6$\,keV), B (\textit{PCA} channels 15--35, $\sim6$--$16$\,keV) and C (\textit{PCA} channels 36--255, $\sim16$--$60$\,keV).  We chose these energy bands to be consistent with the energy bands used by the model-independent classification of variability classes of GRS 1915 in \citet{Belloni_GRS_MI}.  For each of the energy-filtered lightcurves produced we estimated background using \texttt{pcabackest} from the \texttt{FTOOLS} package \citep{Blackburn_FTools} with the \textit{PCA} faint source background model\footnote{\url{http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/xte/calib\_data/pca\_bkgd/Faint/pca\_bkgd\_cmfaintl7\_eMv20051128.mdl}}. In all observations, we found that counts in the C band were consistent with background.  We then created Lightcurves $L_A$ and $L_B$ from background-subtracted photons counted in the A and B bands respectively.  We used these lightcurves to define the full-band lightcurve ($L_T=L_A+L_B$) and the soft colour ($C_1=L_B/L_A$) of each observation.  To complement the Fourier spectra, we also constructed Generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodograms of $L_T$ from each dataset, a modified version of the standard Lomb-Scargle periodogram \citep{Lomb_LombScargle, Scargle_LombScargle} that takes into account errors in the dataset \citep{Irwin_LombScargle}.  Using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram instead of the Fourier periodogram here allows us to sample the low-frequency behaviour of lightcurves with data gaps.  This is important, for example, in lightcurves which show two populations of flares, as it allows each population to be studied independently by cropping the other from the lightcurve.
\par We also used data from \citealt{Altamirano_IGR_FH} to sample the long-term colour evolution of IGR J17091.  We use 2 hardness ratios defined by \citeauthor{Altamirano_IGR_FH}: $H_{A1}$ and $H_{A2}$, corresponding to the ratios of the 2--3.5\,keV band against the 3.5--6\,keV band and the 6--9.7\,keV band against the 9.7--16\,keV band respectively.
\par When possible, if low-frequency peaks were present in the Lomb-Scargle spectrum of an observation, we used the position of the highest peak to define a value for a period.  This period was then used to rebin data by phase (or `fold' the data) to search for reccurent hysteretic patterns in the hardness-Intensity diagram (hereafter HID$_1$, a plot of $L_T$ against $C_1$).  We found that quasi-periodic oscillations in our observations tended to show significant frequency shifts on timescales shorter than the length of the observations.  As such, we employed the variable-period folding algorithm outlined in Appendix \ref{app:Flares} where appropriate.  For cases in which this algorithm was not appropriate, we considered small sections of each lightcurve, with a length equivalent to small number of periods, before performing folding.
\par Additionally, in observations which showed a pattern of high-amplitude X-ray flaring in $L_T$, we used our own algorithm to find individual flares (this algorithm is described in Appendix \ref{app:Flares}) and collect statistics on the amplitude, duration and profile of these events.
\par A list of all observations used in this study can be found in Appendix \ref{app:Obsids}.

\subsection{\textit{Swift}}

\par In this paper, we consider data from the Burst Alert Telescope (\textit{BAT}, \citealt{Barthelmy_BAT}), and the X-ray Telescope (\textit{XRT}, \citealt{Burrows_XRT}) aboard Swift Gamma-ray Burst Mission \citep{Gehrels_Swift}.  IGR J17091-3624 was observed with \textit{XRT} for a total of 172 pointed XRT observations between MJDs 55575 and 56600, corresponding to Target IDs 31921, 34543, 30967, 30973, 31920, 35096, 67137, 81917, 522245, 677582 and 677981.  These observations were interrupted during sun constraints centred on MJDs 55907 and 56272.  We created a long-term 0.3--10\,keV \textit{Swift/XRT} light curve, with one bin per pointed observation, using the online light-curve generator provided by the UK Swift Science Data Centre (UKSSDC; \citealp{Evans_Swift1}).  We have also created a long-term 15--50\,keV lightcurve using the publicly available \textit{Swift/BAT} daily-averaged light curve\footnote{\url{http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/weak/IGRJ17091-3624/}}.  These are shown in Figure \ref{fig:allmissions} Panels (b) and (c) respectively.

\subsection{\textit{INTEGRAL}}

\par The INTErnational Gamma Ray Astrophisical Laboratory (\textit{INTEGRAL}, \citealp{Winkler_IBIS}) is a medium-sized ESA mission launched in 2002. Unique hard X-ray (15--1000\,keV with the ISGRI detector plane) sensitivity and wide field of view make \textit{INTEGRAL} ideally suited to surveying the hard X-ray sky (see \citet{Bird_Survey} and \citet{Krivonos_Survey} for recent surveys). 
\par \textit{INTEGRAL} observations are divided into short ($\sim$2\,ks) pointings called Science Windows (ScWs). We analyse all available observations of IGR J17091 with \textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS \citep{Ubertini_IBIS} between MJD 55575--55625 where the source is less than 12 degrees from the centre of the field of view and where there is more the 1\,ks of good ISGRI time per ScW. This corresponds to the spectrally hardest period of the 2011-2013 outburst. The filtering of observations results in a total of 188 Science Windows which were processed using the Offline Science Analysis (OSA) software version 10.2 following standard data reduction procedures\footnote{http://www.isdc.unige.ch/integral/analysis} in four energy bands (20--40, 40--100, 100--150, 150--300\,keV). These bands were selected as they are standard energy bands used in the surveys of \citet{Bird_Survey} and \citet{Bazzano_Survey} and allow comparison to these previous works. Images were created at the ScW level as well as a single mosaic of all Science Windows in each energy band.

\subsection{\textit{XMM-Newton}}
\label{sec:xmmdata}

\par In this paper we only consider data from the European Photon Imaging Camera (\textit{EPIC} \citealp{Bignami_EPIC}) aboard \textit{XMM-Newton} \citep{Jansen_XMM}.   \textit{EPIC} consists of one telescope with a pn-type CCD (\textit{EPIC-pn}, \citealp{Struder_PN}) and two telescopes with MOS CCDs (\textit{EPIC-MOS1} and \textit{-MOS2}, \citealp{Turner_MOS}).
\par \textit{XMM/Newton} observed IGR J17091 thrice during the period from 2011--2013 (represented by the blue arrows in Figure \ref{fig:allmissions}).  One of these (OBSID 0721200101) was made on 12 September 2013; we do not consider this observation further as IGR J17091 had returned to quiescence by this time \citep{Altamirano_Quiescence}.  The remaining two observations, corresponding to OBSIDs 0677980201 and 0700381301 respectively, were taken on March 27 2011 (MJD 55647) and September 29 2012 (MJD 56199).
\par During observation 0677980201, \textit{EPIC-pn} was operating in burst mode and \textit{EPIC-MOS} was operating in timing mode.  Given the low efficiency of burst mode, we only consider data from \textit{EPIC-MOS} for this observation.  During observation 0700381301, \textit{EPIC-pn} was operating in timing mode, and thus we use data from \textit{EPIC-pn} for this observation.
\par We used the \textit{XMM-Newton} Science Analysis Software version 15.0.0 (\texttt{SAS}, see \citealp{Ibarra_sas}) to extract calibrated event lists from \textit{EPIC} in both observations.  We used these to construct lightcurves to study the X-ray variability, following standard analysis threads\footnote{\url{http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton/sas-threads}}.

\subsection{\textit{Chandra}}

\par In this paper we consider data from the Advanced CCD Imaging Camera (\textit{ACIS}, \citealp{Nousek_ACIS}) and the High Resolution Camera (\textit{HRC}, \citealp{Murray_HRC}) aboard \textit{Chandra} \citep{Weisskopf_Chandra}.  \textit{Chandra} made 7 observations of IGR J17091 during the period 2011--2013.  Four of these observations were taken after IGR J17091 returned to quiescence, and we do not consider these further in this paper.  The Chandra observations log is reported in Table \ref{tab:Chandra}.

\label{tab:Chandra}
\end{table}

\par We analysed these data using \texttt{CIAO} version 4.8 \citep{Fruscione_Ciao}, following the standard analysis threads. In order to apply the most recent calibration files (CALDB 4.7.0, \citealp{Graessle_ChaCALDB}), we reprocessed the data from the three observations using the \texttt{chandra\_repro} script\footnote{See e.g. \url{http://cxc.harvard.edu/ciao/ahelp/chandra_repro.html}}, and used this to produce data products following standard procedures.
\par The first Chandra observation(OBSID 12505) of this source was made shortly after it went into outburst in February 2011. It was a 1\,ks observation performed to refine the position of the X-Ray source, using the High-Resolution Camera in Imaging mode (HRC-I). We created the 0.06--10\,kev light curve accounting for the Dead Time Factor (DTF) to correct the exposure time and count rate, due to the deviation of the detector from the standard detection efficiency,  using the \texttt{dmextract} tool in the \texttt{CIAO} software.
\par Two additional observations (OBSIDs 12405 and 12406) were performed within 214 days of this first observation, using the High Energy Transmition Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board \textit{Chandra}. The incident X-Ray flux was dispersed onto \textit{ACIS} using a narrow strip array configuration (ACIS-S). Continuous Clocking and Time Exposure modes were use in each observation respectively (see \citealp{King_IGRWinds} for further details). We exclude any events below 0.4\,keV, since the grating efficiency is essentially zero below this energy. In the case of the OBSID 12405 observations we also excluded the Flight Grade 66 events in the event file, as they were not appropriately graded. We extracted the 0.5-10\,kev HEGTS light curves, excluding the zeroth-order flux, adopting standard procedures.

\subsection{\textit{Suzaku}}

\par In this paper, we only consider data from the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (\textit{XIS}, \citealp{Koyama_XIS}) aboard \textit{Suzaku} \citep{Mitsuda_Suzaku}.  \textit{Suzaku} observed IGR J17091 twice during the period 2011--2013; a 42.1\,ks observation on October 2--3, 2012 (MJD 56202--56203, ObsID: 407037010) and an 81.9\,ks observation on February 19--21, 2013 (MJD 56342--56344, ObsID: 407037020). \textit{XIS} consists of four X-ray CCDs (\textit{XIS} 0, 1, 2 and 3), and all them except for XIS 2 were operating in the 1/4 window mode which has a minimum time resolution of 2 seconds.
\par We analysed the \textit{Suzaku} data using {\it HEASOFT} 6.19 in the following standard procedures after reprocessing the data with \texttt{aepipeline} and the latest calibration database (version 20160607).  We extracted \textit{XIS} light curves in the 0.7--10 keV range, and subtracted background individually for XIS 0, 1 and 3 and then summed these to obtain the total background.  We created Power density spectra (PDS) using {\tt powspec} in the {\tt XRONOS} package.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Outburst Evolution}

\par The 2011-2013 outburst of IGR J17091-3624 was first detected with \textit{Swift/XRT} on MJD 55595 (3 Feb 2011) \citep{Krimm_IGROutburst}, and was observed by \textit{RXTE}\ , \textit{Swift/XRT}, \textit{Swift/BAT} and \textit{INTEGRAL/ISGRI} (see Figure \ref{fig:allmissions}, Panels a, b, c, d respectively).  There were also pointed observations by \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra} and \textit{Suzaku} during this time (denoted by coloured arrows in Figure \ref{fig:allmissions}).
\par \textit{RXTE}\ data were taken within the first week of the outburst, but they were heavily contiminated by the nearby source GX 349+2 \citep{Rodriguez_Contamination}.  Thus these data are not considered here.
\par The onset of the outburst can be seen in the \textit{Swift/BAT} lightcurve (Figure \ref{fig:allmissions} Panel c).  In a 22 day period between MJDs 55584 and 55608, the 15--50\,keV intensity from IGR J17091 rose from $\sim9$\,mCrab to a peak of $\sim110$\,mCrab.  This onset rise in intensity can also be seen in 0.3--10\,keV \textit{Swift/XRT} data and 20--40\,keV \textit{INTEGRAL/ISGRI} data.
\par After peak intensity, the 15--50\,keV flux (\textit{Swift/BAT}) began to steadily decrease, until returning to a level of $\sim$20\,mCrab by MJD 55633.  A similar decrease in flux can be seen in the data obtained by \textit{INTEGRAL} at this time (Figure \ref{fig:allmissions} Panel (d).  However, there was no corresponding fall in the flux at lower energies; both the long-term 2--16\,keV \textit{RXTE}\ data and \textit{Swift/XRT} data (Panels a and b respectively) show relatively constant fluxes of 45\,mCrab between MJDs 55608 and 55633.
\par The significant decrease in high-energy flux during this time corresponds to IGR J17091 transitioning from a hard state to a soft intermediate state \citep{Pahari_RhoDiff}.  This transition coincides with a radio flare reported by \citet{Rodriguez_D} which was observed by the Australian Telescope Compact Array (\textit{ATCA}).
\par \citealp{Altamirano_10Hz} first reported a 10\,mHz QPO in \textit{RXTE}\ data on MJD 55634 , evolving into `Heartbeat-like' flaring by MJD 55639 \citep{Altamirano_Discovery}.  Between MJDs 55634 and 55879, the global \textit{RXTE}\ lightcurve shows large fluctuations in intensity on timescales of days to weeks, ranging from a minimum of $\sim1$\,mCrab on MJD 55731 to a maximum of $\sim66$\,mCrab on MJD 55756.  The \textit{Swift/XRT} lightcurve shows fluctuations that mirror those seen by \textit{RXTE}\ during this period, but the amplitude of the fluctuations is significantly reduced.
\par \textit{Swift/XRT} was unable to observe again until MJD 55952.  Between this date and MJD 55989, \textit{Swift/XRT} observed a gradual decrease in intensity corresponding to a return to the low/hard state \citep{Drave_Return}.
\par Between MJD 55989 and the end of the outburst on MJD 56445, we see secondary peaks in the \textit{Swift/XRT}, \textit{Swift/BAT} and \textit{INTEGRAL/ISGRI} lightcurves that evolve over timescales of $\lesssim100$ days.  Similar humps have been seen before in lightcurves from other objects, for example the black hole candidate XTE J1650-500 \citep{Tomsick_MiniOutbursts} and the neutron stars SAX J1808.4-3658 \citep{Wijnands_1808} and SAX J1750.8-2900 \citep{Allen_1750}.  These humps are referred to as `re-flares' (also as `rebrightenings',  `echo-outbursts', `mini-outbursts' or a `flaring tail', e.g. \citealp{Patruno_Reflares2}).  We see a total of 3 apparent re-flares in the \textit{Swift/BAT} data, centred approximately at MJDs 56100, 56220 and 56375.
\par The observation with \textit{XMM-Newton/EPIC-pn} on MJD 56547 (12 September 2013) recorded a rate of 0.019 cts s$^{-1}$.  An observation with \textit{EPIC-pn} in 2007, while IGR J17091 was in quiescence \citep{Wijnands_Quiescence}, detected a similar count rate of 0.020 cts s$^{-1}$.  Therefore we define MJD 56547 as the upper limit on the endpoint of the 2011-2013 outburst.  As such the outburst, as defined here, lasted for $\lesssim$952 days.
\par After the end of the 2011-2013 outburst, IGR J17091 remained in quiescence until the start of a new outburst around MJD 57444 (26 February 2016, \citealp{Miller_2016Outburst}).

\subsection{\textit{RXTE}}

\par Using the data products described in Section \ref{sec:dex}, we assigned a model-independent variability class to each of the 243 \textit{RXTE}\textit{/PCA} orbits.  To avoid bias, this was done without reference to the classes defined by \citet{Belloni_GRS_MI} to describe the behaviour of GRS 1915.
\par Classes were initially assigned based on analysis of lightcurve profiles, count rate, mean fractional RMS \citep{Vaughan_RMS}, Fourier and Lomb-scargle power spectra and hardness-intensity diagrams.  For observations with significant quasi-periodic variability at a frequency lower than $\sim1$\,Hz, we also attempted to fold lightcurves to analyse count rate and colour as a function of phase.  When flares were present in the lightcurve, we used our algorithm (described in Appendix \ref{app:Flares}) to sample the distribution of parameters such as peak flare count rate, flare rise time and flare fall time.  All parameters were normalised per active PCU, and fractional RMS values were taken from 2--60\,keV lightcurves binned to 0.5\,s.  We identify nine distinct classes, labelled I to IX; we describe these in the following sections.
\par Although the criteria for assigning each class to an observation was different, a number of criteria were given the most weight.  In particular, the detection, $q$-value and peak frequency of a QPO in the range 2\,Hz--10\,Hz were used as criteria for all classes, as well as the presence or absence of high-amplitude quasi-periodic flaring with a frequency between 0.01--1\,Hz.  The folded profile of these flares, as well as the presence of associated harmonics, were also used as classification diagnostics in observations.  Additionally, the presence or absence of low count-rate 'dips' in a lightcurve was used as a criterion for Classes VI, VIII and IX.  Detailed criteria for each individual class are given below in Sections \ref{sec:ClassI} to \ref{sec:ClassIX}.
\par For hardness-intensity diagrams, we describe looping behaviour with the terms `clockwise' and `anticlockwise'; in all cases, these terms refer to the direction of a loop plotted in a hardness-intensity diagram with colour on the $x$-axis and intensity on the $y$-axis.
\par In Appendix \ref{app:Obsids}, we present a list of all orbits used in the study along with the variability classes we assigned to them.
\par In Figure \ref{fig:WhereCls}, we show global 2--16\,keV lightcurves of IGR J17091 during the 2011-2013 outburst.  In each panel, all observations of a given class are highlighted in red.  A characteristic lightcurve is also presented for each class.  In Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} panel (a), we show a plot of average hardness $H_{A2}$ against $H_{A1}$ for each observation, showing the long-term hysteresis of the object in colour-colour space.  Again, observations belonging to each variability class are highlighted.  In Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} panels (b) and (c), we show global hardness-intensity diagrams for $H_{A1}$ and $H_{A2}$ respectively.
\par In Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} Panel (a), we see that IGR J17091-3624 traces a two branched pattern in colour-colour space corresponding to a branch which is soft ($\sim0.9$) in $H_{A1}$ and variable in $H_{A2}$ and a branch which is soft ($\sim0.5$) in $H_{A2}$ and variable in $H_{A1}$.  The `soft' HID shown in Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} Panel (b) is dominated by a branch with a wide spread in $H_{A1}$ and intensities between $\sim40\mbox{--}60$\,mCrab.  A second branch exists at lower intensities, and shows an anticorrelation between intensity and $H_{A1}$.  Finally, the `hard' HID shown in Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} Panel (c) shows an obvious anticorrelation between $H_{A2}$ and intensity, but there is also a secondary branch between $H_{A2}\approx 0.7\mbox{--}0.9$ at a constant intensity of $\sim40$\,mCrab.

\label{fig:IIIisHarder}
\end{figure}

\par For characteristic count rates and colours in each class, we quote the upper and lower quartile values \citep{Kenney_Quartile} instead of the mean.  This is due to the presence of high-amplitude but short-lived flares in many of the classes we describe.  Using the upper and lower quartiles as our measure of average and distribution means that our values will be less susceptible to outlier values of count rate and colour present in these flares.  All count rates have been background corrected (see Section \ref{sec:XTEDA}).
\par We have obtained mean values for these count rate quartiles, as well as values for colour $C_1$ and fractional RMS, by calculating these values individually for each orbit.  Histograms were then constructed from these datasets for each class, such that the mean and standard deviation of these values could be measured for each class.  These values are presented in Table \ref{tab:basicparams}.
\par We describe QPOs in terms of their $q$-value; a measure of coherence defined by the ratio of peak frequency and full-width half-maximum of each QPO.  We collected these values by fitting our power spectra with Lorentzians.

\par For each class, we present three standard data products; a 500\,s lightcurve, a variable-length lightcurve where the length has been selected to best display the variability associated with the class and a Fourier PDS.  Unless otherwise stated in the figure caption, the 500\,s lightcurve and the Fourier PDS are presented at the same scale for all classes.

\subsubsection{Class I --  Figure \ref{fig:Bmulti}}
\label{sec:ClassI}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Bmulti.png}

    \caption{Plots of the Class I observation 96420-01-01-00, orbit 0.  \textit{Top-left}: 1000\,s lightcurve binned on 2 seconds to show lightcurve evolution.  \textit{Top-right}: Fourier Power Density Spectrum.  \textit{Bottom}: 500\,s lightcurve binned on 2 seconds.}
   \label{fig:Bmulti}
\end{figure}

In the 2\,s binned lightcurve of a Class I observation, there is no structured second-to-minute scale variability.  The Fourier PDS of all observations in this class shows broad band noise between $\sim1$--$10$\,Hz, as well as a weak QPO (with a $q$-value of $\sim5$) which peaks at around 5\,Hz.

\subsubsection{Class II -- Figure \ref{fig:Emulti}}

   \label{fig:Emulti}
\end{figure}

\par Class II observations are a factor of $\sim2$ fainter in the $L_T$ band than Class I observations.  They also occupy a different branch in a plot of hardness $H_{A2}$ against flux (see Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder}c).  The PDS shows no significant broad band noise above $\sim1$Hz unlike that which is seen in Class I.  The $\sim$5Hz QPO seen in Class I is absent in Class II.

\subsubsection{Class III -- Figure \ref{fig:Gmulti}}
\label{sec:classIII}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Gmulti.png}

Note that, to emphasise the behaviour of the lightcurve in this class, we have magnified the 500\,s lightcurve y-scale by a factor of 2 compared with the lightcurves presented for other classes.}
   \label{fig:Gmulti}
\end{figure}

\par Unlike Classes I \& II, Class III lightcurves show structured flaring, with a peak-to-peak recurrence time of $42$--$80$\,s.  Most flares consist of a steady $\sim60$\,s rise in count rate and then an additional and sudden rise to a peak count rate at $\gtrsim200$\,cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$ which lasts for $\lesssim$0.5\,s before returning to continuum level (we have magnified the y-scaling in the lightcurve of Figure \ref{fig:Gmulti} to emphasise this behaviour). This sudden rise is not present in every flare; in some observations it is absent from every flare feature.  No 5Hz QPO is present in the PDS and there is no significant variability in the range between $\sim1\mbox{--}10$Hz.

\par As this class has a well-defined periodicity, we folded data in each observation to improve statistics using the best-fit period obtained from generalised Lomb-Scargle Periodogram Analysis; we show a representative Lomb-Scargle periodogram in Figure \ref{fig:IIILS}.  We find an anticlockwise hysteretic loop in the folded HID$_1$ of all 15 Class III orbits.  In Figure \ref{fig:LoopIII} we show an example of one of these loops.

\par The lightcurves in this class show regular variability with a peak-to-peak recurrence time of $25$--$39$\,s.  We performed peak analysis (see Appendix \ref{app:Flares}) on observations belonging to this class, finding that each peak has a rise time with lower and upper quartile values of $19.5$ and $33.5$ s, a fall time with lower and upper quartile values of $4.6$ and $13.5$\,s and a peak count rate of $159$--$241$\,cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$\ .  There are no prominent significant QPOs in the Fourier PDS above $\sim1$Hz.
\par We folded individual Class IV lightcurves and found anticlockwise hysteretic loops in the HID$_1$ of 14 out of 30 Class IV observations.  In the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:LoopIV} we show an example of one of these loops.  However, we also find clockwise hysteretic loops in 6 Class IV observations, and in 10 orbits the data did not allow us to ascertain the presence of a loop.  We provide an example of both of these in the lower panels of Figure \ref{fig:LoopIV}.  We note that the structure of clockwise loops are more complex than anticlockwise loops in Class IV, consisting of several lobes\footnote{In HIDs with multiple lobes, the loop direction we assign to the observation corresponds to the direction of the largest lobe.} rather than a single loop (Figure \ref{fig:LoopIV}, bottom-left).

\par Compared with Class III, the oscillations in Class IV occur with a significantly lower period, with a mean peak-to-peak recurrence time of $\sim30$\,s compared to $\sim60$\,s in Class III.
\par In Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder} we show that Classes III and IV can also be distinguished by average hardness, as Class III tends to have a greater value of $H_{A2}$ than Class IV.

\subsubsection{Class V -- Figure \ref{fig:Kmulti}}
\label{sec:classV}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Kmulti.png}

   \label{fig:Kmulti}
\end{figure}

\par The lightcurves in this class, like in Classes III and IV, show flaring behaviour, with flares separated by a few tens of seconds.  At higher frequencies, the PDS shows a prominent QPO centred at $\sim4$Hz with as $q$-value of $\sim3$.  There is also significant broad band noise between $\sim0.1$--$1$Hz
\par In Figure \ref{fig:id_flares_V} we show that the flaring in this class is more complex than that seen in Classes III and IV.  Class V lightcurves consist of short strongly peaked symmetrical flares (hereafter Type $V_1$) and a longer more complex type of flare (hereafter Type $V_2$).  The Type $V_2$ flare consists of a fast rise to a local maximum in count rate, followed by a $\sim10$\,s period in which this count rate gradually reduces by $\sim50\%$ and then a much faster peak with a maximum count rate between 1 and 2 times that of the initial peak.  In both types of flare, we find that the increase in count rate corresponds with an increase in soft colour.  The two-population nature of flares in Class V can also clearly be seen in Figure \ref{fig:two_popV}, where we show a two-dimensional histogram of flare peak count rate against flare duration.
\par We folded all individual Class V lightcurves, in each case cropping out regions of $V_2$ flaring.  We find clockwise hysteretic loops in the HID$_1$ of 30 out of 33 Class V observations, suggesting a lag in the aforementioned relation between count rate and soft colour.  In the upper panel Figure \ref{fig:LoopV} we present an example of one of these loops.  In one observation however, we found an anticlockwise loop in the HID$_1$ (shown in Figure \ref{fig:LoopV} lower-left panel).  We were unable to ascertain the presence of loops in the remaining 2 orbits; for the sake of completeness, we show one of these in the lower-right panel of Figure \ref{fig:LoopV}.

\subsubsection{Class VI -- Figure \ref{fig:Lmulti}}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Lmulti.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \caption{Plots of the Class VI observation 96420-01-09-00, orbit 0.  \textit{Top-left}: 750\,s lightcurve binned on 2 seconds to show lightcurve evolution.  \textit{Top-right}: Fourier Power Density Spectrum.  \textit{Bottom}: Lightcurve binned on 1 second.}
   \label{fig:Lmulti}
\end{figure}

\par The lightcurves of observations of this class show large dips in count rate; this can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Lmulti} at, for example, $t\approx125$--$150$\,s .  These dips vary widely in duration, from $\sim5$ to $\sim50$ seconds, and the count rate in both $L_A$ and $L_B$ fall to a level consistent with background.  The dips' rise and fall times are fast, both lasting no longer than a second.  They do not appear to occur with any regular periodicity.
\par Aside from the dips, Class VI observations show other structures in their lightcurves.  Large fluctuations in count rate, by factors of $\lesssim3$, occur on timescales of $\sim1\mbox{--}5$ s; no periodicity in these oscillations could be found.  This behaviour is reflected in the PDS, which shows high-amplitude broad band noise below $\sim0.5$Hz with RMS-normalized power \citep{Belloni_RMSNorm} of up to $\sim1.1 $Hz$^{-1}$.  As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Lmulti}, this feature takes the form of a broad shoulder of noise which shows a either weak peak or no clear peak at all.  The $\sim5$Hz QPO seen in the PDS of other classes is not present in Class VI observations.
\par We attempted to fold all individual Class VI lightcurves, ignoring the sections of data corresponding to the large count rate dips described above.  In general, folding lightcurves belonging to this class is difficult; many orbits showed low-amplitude oscillations which were difficult to fold using our flare-finding algorithm (see Appendix \ref{app:Flares}), while many others only showed oscillatory behaviour for a small number of periods between each pair of dips.  As such, we only succesfully folded 23 of the 40 Class VI orbits.  Of these, 19 showed clockwise loops in the HID$_1$ (top panel, Figure \ref{fig:LoopVI}), 3 showed anticlockwise loops (bottom-left panel, Figure \ref{fig:LoopVI}).  In the remaining 1 observation, the data did not allow us to ascertain the presence of loops (bottom-right panel, Figure \ref{fig:LoopVI}).
\par Like in Class VI, we note that the clockwise loops in Class VI appear more complex than clockwise loops.  Again, the clockwise loop shown in Figure \ref{fig:LoopVI} appears to have a 2-lobe structure; this is repeated in all clockwise loops found in this class.

\subsubsection{Class VII -- Figure \ref{fig:Nmulti}}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Nmulti.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}

   \label{fig:Nmulti}
\end{figure}

\par Class VII shows high-amplitude flaring behaviour with a peak-to-peak recurrence time of $6$--$12$\,s.  In Figure \ref{fig:spect} we show a dynamical Lomb-Scargle spectrogram of a Class VII observation, showing that the fast flaring behaviour has a frequency which moves substantially over time.  This in turn accounts for the large spread in the value of the flare peak-to-peak recurrence time.
\par In Figure \ref{fig:spect} we show that the peak frequency of the QPO also varies in a structured way.  We also suggest that the variabilitity of the frequency is itself a QPO with a period of $\sim150$.
\par At higher frequencies, the PDS shows a weak QPOs centred at $\sim8$Hz, with a $q$-values of $\sim2$.
\par We used our flare-finding algorithm (see Appendix \ref{app:Flares}) to perform variable-frequency folding of Class VII orbits.  We find clockwise loops in 9 out of 11 Class VII orbits.  In the remaining two observations, the oscillations were extremely fast.  As a result, the errors in the HID$_1$ of these too observations were too large to succesfully select peaks, and we are unable to confirm or reject the presence of loops.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Class VIII -- Figure \ref{fig:Omulti}}

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Omulti.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}

Inset is a zoom of the 25\,s portion of the lightcurve highlighted in cyan, to show the second-scale structure in the lightcurve.}
   \label{fig:Omulti}
\end{figure}

\par The lightcurve of this variability class shows the dipping behaviour seen in Class VI, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Omulti} at $t\approx125$--$150$\,s.  The dips are less frequent than in Class VI.  The behaviour outside of the dips is dominated by highly structured high-amplitude oscillations consisting of flares with a peak to peak separation of $3.4\pm1.0$\,s.  The PDS shows this behaviour as a very significant ($q$-value > 20) QPO; two harmonics of this QPO are also visible.  The PDS also shows a strong ($q$-value = 4.7) QPO at $\sim9$Hz.
\par We attempted to fold Class VIII lightcurves, ignoring the portions of data corresponding to dips, using our flare-finding algorithm.  The high frequency of the dominant oscillation in Class VIII resulted in large errors in the peak times of individual flares, which translated to large errors in all HID$_1$s; however, we were able to ascertain the presence in loops in 8 out of 16 orbits.  All 8 of these loops are clockwise.

\subsubsection{Class IX -- Figure \ref{fig:Qmulti}}
\label{sec:ClassIX}
\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Qmulti.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \caption{Plots of the Class IX observation 96420-01-35-02, orbit 1.  \textit{Top-left}: 1200\,s lightcurve binned on 2 seconds to show lightcurve evolution.  \textit{Top-right}: Fourier Power Density Spectrum.  \textit{Bottom}: Lightcurve binned on 2 seconds.}
   \label{fig:Qmulti}
\end{figure}

\par The 1\,s lightcurve of a Class IX observation is superficially similar to the lightcurve of a Class I observation, with little obvious structured variability at timescales larger than 2 s; however, large count rate dips like those seen in Classes VI and VIII (e.g. the feature at $t\approx410$\,s in the lightcurve of Figure \ref{fig:Qmulti}) are very occasionally observed.  These dips may in turn be coupled to short second-scale flares in which count rate briefly increases by a factor of 2--3.
\par Outside of these dips and flares, the lightcurve of a Class IX observation is indistinguishable from the lightcurve of a Class I or Class II observation.  However, in Figure \ref{fig:IIIisHarder}, we show that Class IX occupies a very different part of the global $H_{A2}$/$H_{A1}$ colour-colour diagram.  Class IX observations show a significantly larger $H_{A2}$ than Class I and II observations, but a significantly lower $H_{A1}$.
\par The PDS reveals significant broad band noise peaked at $\sim$0.3 Hz, and the $\sim5$Hz QPO seen in other classes is absent.  \citet{Altamirano_HFQPO} discovered high frequency ($\sim66$Hz) QPOs in observations corresponding to this variability class.

\subsection{Swift}

\par Observations with \textit{Swift} took place throughout the 2011-2013 outburst of IGR J17091-3624.  Between MJDs 55622 and 55880, 17 \textit{Swift/XRT} were at least partly simultaneous with an \textit{RXTE}\ observation, corresponding to at least one observation of all 9 classes.  In each case, the \textit{Swift} and \textit{RXTE}\ lightcurves were similar.  The remainder of the \textit{Swift/XRT} observations during this time were also consistent with belonging to one of our nine classes.  Given that the \textit{RXTE}\ data have higher count rate and time resolution, we do not further discuss the \textit{Swift} observations taken before MJD 55880.  A more detailed comparison of \textit{RXTE}\ and \textit{Swift} data is beyond the scope of this paper.
\par Between MJD 55952 and 56445, \textit{Swift} observations showed IGR J17091-3624 decreasing in flux.  For all observations longer than 500 s, we rebinned the lightcurves to 10\,s and calculated the RMS.  We find the lower and upper quartiles of the fractional RMS in these measurements to be 18.3\% and 21.7\% respectively.  \textit{INTEGRAL} observations taken as part of a scan programme of the Galactic Plane \citep{Fiocchi_PlaneScan} and reported by \citet{Drave_Return} suggest that IGR J17091-3624 returned to the hard state between MJDs 55952 and 55989.  Therefore these observations sample IGR J17091-3624 the hard state.

\subsection{INTEGRAL}

\par The results of the \textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS analysis are presented in Table \ref{tab:IBIS_results}. We see clear detections of IGR J17091-3624 in all energy bands during the hardest period (MJD 55575--55625) of the 2011--2013 outburst. Conversion from detected counts to flux was achieved using an \textit{INTEGRAL}/IBIS observation of the Crab taken between MJD 57305.334 and 57305.894. Conversion from Crab units to standard flux units was obtained by conversion factors listed in \citet{Bird_Survey} and \citet{Bazzano_Survey}.

Conversion between counts and mCrab was obtained using an observation of the Crab taken during Revolution 1597 between MJD 57305.334 and 57305.894 and the conversion factors of \citet{Bird_Survey} and \citet{Bazzano_Survey}.}
\label{tab:IBIS_results}
\end{table*}

\par Comparing these results with those of \citet{Bazzano_Survey}, we see that IGR J17091 is detected for the first time above 150\,keV with a detection significance of 7.6\,$\sigma$, corresponding to a flux of $2.24\pm0.29\times10^{-10}$\,ergs~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$\ (Figure \ref{fig:sigmap}).

\subsection{Chandra}

\par In Figure \ref{fig:Cha_lc}, we present lightcurves from the three \textit{Chandra} observations considered in this paper (see also Table \ref{tab:Chandra} for details of these observations).

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth, trim = 0.6cm 0 3.9cm 0]{Chandra.eps}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \caption{1 ks segments of lightcurves taken from \textit{Chandra} observations 12505, 12405 and 12406, showing Class I, Class VII and Class IX variability respectively.  The lightcurve presented for observation 12505 is for the energy range 0.06-10\,keV, while the other two lightcurves are for the energy range 0.5-10\,keV.  All three lightcurves are binned to 0.5\,s.}
   \label{fig:Cha_lc}
\end{figure}

\par Observation 12505 was performed within 24 hours of \textit{RXTE}\ observation 96420-01-02-01, which showed Class I variability.  No structured variability is seen in the lightcurve of OBSID 12505 (Figure \ref{fig:Cha_lc}, upper panel), which is consistent with Class I.  Note that we consider the energy range 0.06-10\,keV for this observation but 0.5-10\,keV for observations 12405 and 12406.
\par Observation 12405 was performed within 24 hours of \textit{RXTE}\ observation 96420-01-23-03, which showed Class V variability.  The two observations were not simultaneous; OBSID 12405 began $\sim8.4$ ks after OBSID 96420-01-2303 finished.  The lightcurve of \textit{Chandra} OBSID 12405 (shown in Figure \ref{fig:Cha_lc}, middle panel) shows a mean count rate of 41\,cts\,s$^{-1}$.  The lightcurve shows fast flaring behaviour (with a recurrence time on the order of 10s of seconds) in which the frequency changes widely on timescales of $\sim1000$\,s.  This observation strongly resembles a Class VII lightcurve, but with its characteristic timescales increased by a factor of $\sim4$.  This leads to the possibility that the low number of Class VII \textit{RXTE}\ observations we identify is due to a selection effect; we would not have been able to see this observation's long-term Class VII-like behaviour if the observation had been shorter than $\sim2$ ks.
\par Observation 12406 was performed within 24 hours of \textit{RXTE}\ observation 96420-01-32-06, which showed Class IX variability.  The lightcurve presented for \textit{Chandra} OBSID 12406 shows a mean count rate (36 cts s$^{-1}$), which is consistent with IGR J17091 being harder in this observation than in Observation 12505.  This, combined with the lack of variability seen in its lightcurve, suggests that Observation 12505 is consistent with Class IX.

\subsection{XMM-Newton}

\par In Figure \ref{fig:XMM} we show lightcurves from two \textit{XMM-Newton} observations.  The lightcurve of \textit{XMM-Newton} observation 0677980201, shown in the upper panel of Figure \ref{fig:XMM}, shows the regular flares characteristic of Class IV variability.  A simultaneous \textit{RXTE}\ observation (OBSID 96420-01-05-000) also showed Class IV variability.

\begin{figure}

   \label{fig:XMM}
\end{figure}

\par \textit{XMM-Newton} observation 070038130, shown in the lower panel of Figure \ref{fig:XMM}, was made after the end of \textit{RXTE}\ observations IGR J17091-3624.  As such it cannot be compared with contemporaneous \textit{RXTE}\ data.  The 5\,s binned lightcurve shows no apparent variability, but a Fourier PDS of the observation (shown in Figure \ref{fig:xmmqpo}) reveals a QPO centred at around $\sim0.15$Hz and a broad band noise component at lower frequencies.  \citet{Drave_Return} reported that IGR J17091 transited to the hard state in February 2012, seven months before this observation was taken.  As such, we find that observation 0677980201 samples the hard state in IGR J17091 and is thus beyond the scope of our set of variability classes.

We sample observation 0700381301 up to a frequency of 10\,Hz, while the 2\,s time resolution of observation 407037010 results in a Nyquist frequency of 0.25\,Hz.}
   \label{fig:xmmqpo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{\textit{Suzaku}}

\par The two {\it Suzaku} observations of IGR J17091-3624 considered, OBSIDs 407037010 and 407037020, were performed during the 2nd and 3rd re-flares of the hard state phase of the 2011--2013 outburst.  OBSID 407037010 was taken simultaneously with \textit{XMM-Newton} observation 0700381301.  The XIS 0 count rates are 7.8 cts\,s$^{-1}$ and 2.5\,cts\,s$^{-1}$ respectively.
\par Neither lightcurve shows `heartbeats' or any other type of GRS 1915-like variability.  However, we find evidence of a low frequency QPO feature at $\sim$0.15 Hz in the OBSID 407037010; this QPO is also seen in \textit{XMM-Newton} observation 0700381301 (Figure \ref{fig:xmmqpo}).  The presence of a QPO below 1\,Hz and flat-topped power density spectrum confirm that IGR J17091 was in the hard state at this time.

\section{Discussion}

\par Using observations from \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{RXTE}\ and \textit{Chandra}, we describe the complex variability seen in IGR J17091 as a set of nine variability `classes', labelled I to IX.  These classes are distinguished from each other by values of upper and lower quartile (i.e. 25\textsuperscript{th} and 75\textsuperscript{th} percentile) count rates, mean RMS, the presence of QPOs in Fourier PDS, the shape of flare and dip features in the lightcurve and the presence of loops in the 6--16/2--6 keV hardness-intensity diagram HID$_1$.  See Section \ref{sec:results} for a full description of these classes.
\par The classification of some observations is clearer than others.  Some orbits were too short to definitively quantify the behaviour of the source, whereas some other orbits contain a transition between two classes.  An example lightcurve showing a transition from Class III to Class IV is presented in Figure \ref{fig:HybridClasses}.

   \label{fig:HybridClasses}
\end{figure}

\par Our set of classes is analogous to, but not based upon, the set of variability classes defined by \citealt{Belloni_GRS_MI} to describe the behaviour of the similarly complex LMXB GRS 1915.  This ensures that our set of classes is not biased by an \textit{a priori} assumption that the two objects are similar.  However if we do assume that wide range of variability seen in these two objects are driven by the same physical processes, a direct comparison between the variability classes in the two systems can further our understanding of the physics that drive these exotic objects.
\par We also use all 2011-2013 IGR J17091-3624 data from \textit{RXTE} , \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, \textit{Swift}, \textit{INTEGRAL} and \textit{Suzaku} to analyse the long-term evolution of the 2011--2013 outburst.  This in turn corresponds to all available X-ray data taken during this outburst.

\subsection{Variability Classes: IGR J17091 vs. GRS 1915}

\par As observations of IGR J17091 and GRS 1915 suffer from different values of interstellar absorption $N_H$, we cannot directly compare the absolute colours of these two objects.  However, we can compare the evolution of colour both over time and as a function of count rate.  We therefore use these parameters, along with power spectra and lightcurve morphology, when comparing GRS 1915 with IGR J17091.
\par For seven of our classes, we were able to assign the closest matching class described by \citealt{Belloni_GRS_MI} for GRS 1915 (see Table \ref{tab:class_assign}).  We are unable to find analogues to our classes VII and VIII in observations of GRS 1915, and we suggest that these classes are unique to IGR J17091.

\begin{table}

\caption{The nine variability classes of IGR J17091-3624, showing the name of the closest corresponding variability class in GRS 1915+105.  The names of GRS 1915+105 classes are taken from \citet{Belloni_GRS_MI}, where more detailed descriptions can be found.  Eight additional classes of GRS 1915+105 have been described; we do not find analogies to these classes in IGR J17091-3624.}

\end{table}

\par Below, we evaluate our mapping between GRS 1915 and IGR J17091 classes, and interpret the differences between each matched pair.

\subsubsection{Classes I and II -- Figures \ref{fig:Bmulti}, \ref{fig:Emulti}}

\label{sec:DisI}

\par Classes I and II both show low count rates and little structure in their lightcurves.  The two classes in GRS 1915 that also show this lightcurve behaviour are Class $\chi$\footnote{Note that, in GRS 1915+105, Class $\chi$ is further subdivided into four classes based on hard colour \citep{Belloni_GRS_MI,Pahari_Chi}.  As we cannot obtain hard colour for IGR J17091, we treat $\chi$ as a single variability class here.} and Class $\phi$.  \citealt{Belloni_GRS_MI} differentiate between Classes $\phi$ and $\chi$ based on the hard colour (corresponding to $C_2$), as Class $\chi$ has a significantly higher value for this colour than Class $\phi$.

\par Data from \textit{RXTE}\  indicates that the transition from the hard state to the soft intermediate state between MJDs 55612 and 55615 \citep{Drave_Return}.  This was confirmed by a radio spectrum taken on MJD 55623 which was consistent with an observation of discrete ejecta \citep{Rodriguez_D}.  This observation of discrete ejecta at the transition between the hard state and the intermediate state has been reported in other LMXBS (e.g. XTE J1550-564, \citealp{Rodriguez_XTE}), and has also been associated with transitions to the $\chi$ Class in GRS 1915 (\citealp{Rodriguez_Ejection}, see also review by \citealp{Fender_Jets}).

\par Using Fourier PDS, we conclude that Class I is analogous to Class $\chi$ in GRS 1915, while Class II is analogous to Class $\phi$.  In Class $\chi$ observations of GRS 1915, broad band noise between $\sim1-10$Hz and a QPO at around 5Hz are seen in the PDS.  We find that both of these are present in Class I observations of IGR J17091.  On the other hand, we find that Class $\phi$ observations of GRS 1915 do not show this broad band noise, and show either a weak ($q$-value $\lesssim 3$) QPO at $\sim5$Hz or no QPO at all.  We find that the weak QPO and lack of broad band noise are also seen in the PDS of Class II observations.

\subsubsection{Classes III and IV -- Figures \ref{fig:Gmulti}, \ref{fig:Jmulti}}

\par Classes III and IV both show highly regular flaring activity in their lightcurves, but they differ in terms of timescale and pulse profile.  As can be seen in lightcurves in Figure \ref{fig:Jmulti}, flares in Class IV occur every $\sim32$\,s and are nearly identical to each other in shape.  On the other hand, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Gmulti}, flares in Class III occur every $\sim61$\,s and may or may not end in a much faster sharp peak which is never seen in Class IV.  In Figure \ref{fig:III_IV_burst} we show a two-dimensional histogram of flare peak count rate against flare duration, showing all flares in all observations classified as Class III or Class IV.  In this figure, we can see that flares tend to group in one of two regions in count rate-duration space; a region between $\sim90\mbox{--}110$ \,cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$ and $\sim35\mbox{--}55$\,s, corresponding to flares seen in Class III, and a region between $\sim150\mbox{--}250$ \,cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$ and $\sim20\mbox{--}55$\,s, corresponding to flares seen in Class IV.  From this plot, we conclude that the flares seen in Class III exist in a different population to the flares seen in Class IV.
\par The GRS 1915 classes that show behaviour most similar to these are $\rho$ and $\nu$; both produce similar structures in their lightcurve, but Class $\nu$ is differentiated from Class $\rho$ by the presence of a secondary count rate peak which occurs $\sim5$\,s after the primary \citep{Belloni_GRS_MI}.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, trim = 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm]{GJBurst.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \caption{Every flare in all observations identified as Class III or Class IV, plotted in a two-dimensional histogram of flare peak count rate against flare duration to show the two-population nature of these events.  Flares belonging to Class IV occupy the distribution at higher peak rate and lower duration, whereas flares belonging to Class III occupy the distribution at lower peak rate and higher duration.}
   \label{fig:III_IV_burst}
\end{figure}

\par The secondary peak is present in most Class III observations and some Class IV observations (Figure \ref{fig:III_IV_spike}), suggesting that both classes consist of a mix of $\rho$-like and $\nu$-like observations.  However, the poor statistics sometimes make the presence of this secondary peak difficult to detect.  As such, we do not use the presence or absence of this peak as a criterion when assigning classes.  Instead we choose to separate Classes III and IV based on the larger-scale structure in their lightcurves (see Section \ref{sec:classIV}).  Due to the aforementioned difference in burst populations between the two classes, we suggest that classes III and IV do represent two distinct classes rather than a single class with a period that drifts over time.  We suggest that Classes $\rho$ and $\nu$ in GRS 1915 could also be re-partitioned in this way.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth, trim = 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm]{classIIIsecpeak.png}
    \captionsetup{singlelinecheck=off}
    \caption{Lightcurve from Class III observation 96420-01-10-01 of IGR J17091-3624, with pairs of primary and secondary count rate spikes highlighted in cyan and red respectively.  The yellow region highlights a primary count rate spike that did not produce a secondary.}
   \label{fig:III_IV_spike}
\end{figure}

\par However, HID$_1$ loops are found to generally execute in an anticlockwise direction in Classes III and IV (previously noted by e.g. \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH}); the opposite direction to the clockwise loops in Classes $\rho$ and $\nu$ reported by e.g. \citealp{Belloni_GRS_MI} and repeated by us using the same method we apply to data from IGR J17091-3624 (see Section \ref{sec:dex}).  This suggests that Classes III and IV could be generated by a different physical mechanism to Classes $\rho$ and $\nu$.  Alternatively, Classes III and IV could be generated by the same mechanism as $\rho$ and $\nu$ if some other unknown process was able to alter the spectral evolution of flares in these classes.

\subsubsection{Class V -- Figure \ref{fig:Kmulti}}

\par The lightcurve of a Class V observation appears similar to that of a Class $\mu$ observation of GRS 1915, as both are characterised by rapid $\rho$-like flares which occur less regularly than in Class $\rho$.  In addition to this, flares in Class $\mu$ fall into two clear populations, as do the flares in Class V.  However, significant differences exist between Class V and Class $\mu$.  Class $\mu$ observations are characterised by long ($\sim100$ s) excursions to plateaus of high count rate, a behaviour which is not seen in any Class V observation thus far.
\par We note that the HID$_1$ in Class V observations displays a loop in the clockwise direction; the opposite direction to the looping seen in Classes III and IV but the same direction seen in Class $\mu$.
\par Regarding the two-population nature of flares seen in this class (see Section \ref{sec:classV}), we suggest that V$_2$ flares may simply be two V$_1$ flares that occur close together in time, such that the second flare starts during the decay of the first flare.  This would result in an apparent two-peaked flare structure, as we see in type V$_2$ flares.  This interpretation also accounts for the bimodal distribution of flare duarations shown in the 2D histogram of Figure \ref{fig:two_popV}, as this could be caused by the misinterpretation of two-flare V$_2$ events as a single event.  This also accounts for the Gaussian distribution of peak flare intensities seen in Figure \ref{fig:two_popV}), as the constituents of each V$_2$ event would be from the same population as V$_1$ flares.

\subsubsection{Class VI -- Figure \ref{fig:Lmulti}}

\par Class VI is dominated by long flaring periods which separate periods of low count rate, as can be seen in the lightcurve presented in Figure \ref{fig:Lmulti}.  Similar behaviour is seen in the lightcurves of observations of GRS 1915 belonging to Classes $\lambda$ and $\omega$ \citep{KleinWolt_OmegaClass}.  However, the long count rate `dips' are far less regular in Class VI than in Classes $\lambda$ and $\omega$, and we also note long periods of medium count rate during which neither flares nor dips occur.  This variability class is noted by \citet{Pahari_IGRClasses} who suggest that this class is unique to IGR J17091\footnote{\citet{Pahari_IGRClasses} refers to Class VI as Class C2.}.  However, \citet{Pahari_ClassVI} show that, in a plot of burst decay time against burst rise time, Classes VI and $\lambda$ fall in a straight line, suggesting a similar physical origin for both.
\par While it is cetainly true that Class VI is not a perfect analogue of either Class $\lambda$ or Class $\omega$, Class VI only differs noticeably from Class $\lambda$ during the extended low-variability portions of its lightcurves.  As such, we associate Class VI with Class $\lambda$.

\subsubsection{Class VII -- Figure \ref{fig:Nmulti}}

\par We are unable to find an analogue of Class VII in observations of GRS 1915.  This class, and its apparent uniqueness, have previously been noted by \citealp{Pahari_IGRClasses}\footnote{\citet{Pahari_IGRClasses} refers to Class VII as Class C1.}.  \citeauthor{Pahari_IGRClasses} found  that the $C_2$ hard colour in this class increases during count rate dips and decreases during count rate peaks.  Here we reproduced the results of \citeauthor{Pahari_IGRClasses} and found that the anti-correlation between hard-colour and intensity is not physical, but due to the definition of $C_2$: the count rate in band $L_C$ is approximately constant and consistent with background, and therefore $C_2=L_C/L_A \propto L_A^{-1}$, which will naturally anticorrelate with intensity.
\par Although a correlation between QPO frequency and count rate has been noted in the $\sim5$Hz QPO seen in GRS 1915 (e.g. \citealp{Markwardt_FluxFreqGRS,Vignarca_FluxFreqGRS}), this QPO is also seen in Class VII observations at the same time as the $\sim0.1$Hz QPO.  As such, the flux-frequency relationship in the very low frequency ($\sim0.1$Hz) QPO in Class VII is apparently unique amongst the classes of both IGR J17091 and GRS 1915.

\subsubsection{Class VIII -- Figure \ref{fig:Omulti}}

\par We are unable to find an analogue of Class VIII in observations of GRS 1915.  When it is flaring, the lightcurve waveform is similar to that seen in Class $\rho$, with rapid regular spikes in count rate.  The lightcurve also shows irregular dips in count rate similar to those seen in Class VI and in Class $\lambda$ in GRS 1915.
\par However, the amplitude of the flares in Class VIII is much larger, and the frequency much higher, than in Classes VI or $\lambda$.  The amplitude of the flares in Class VIII can approach $\sim350$cts s$^{-1}$ PCU$^{-1}$, while the flare separation time of 4--5\,s makes Class VIII the fastest flaring activity seen in any class of IGR J17091 or GRS 1915.  As such, we consider this variability class distinct from both Class VI and Class $\lambda$. 

\subsubsection{Class IX - Figure \ref{fig:Qmulti}}

\label{sec:DisIX}

\par Class IX is defined by long periods of high amplitude but unstructured variability (with a broad peaked noise component in the Fourier spectrum peaked at $\sim$0.3 Hz) punctuated with infrequent irregular short-duration `spikes' in which the count rate increases by a factor of $\sim2$--$3$.  A similarity between this Class and Class $\gamma$ in GRS 1915 has been previously noted by \citet{Altamirano_HFQPO}.  However, the irregular spikes seen in some Class IX lightcurves are not reproduced in Class $\gamma$ lightcurves of GRS 1915.

\subsection{General Comparison with GRS 1915+105}

\par Overall, variability in IGR J17091 tends to be faster than structurally similar variability in GRS 1915, as can be noted in Classes III and IV compared to Classes $\rho$ and $\nu$ (see also \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH}).  Additionally, IGR J17091 also displays highly structured variability unlike anything yet seen in GRS 1915, with classes VII and VIII in particular showing very fine detail in their lightcurves.
\par In total we find 2 variability classes which are seen in IGR J17091 but not in GRS 1915, compared with 8 that are seen in GRS 1915 but not in IGR J17091.  As relatively little data exists on GRS 1915-like variability in IGR J17091, the presence of classes in GRS 1915 that are not seen in IGR J17091 could simply be an observational effect.  It is unknown how long each variability class lasts for and, as such, additional variability classes could have occurred entirely while IGR J17091 was not being observed (however, see \citealp{Huppenkothen_ML} for a study on GRS1915 based on more than 16 years of data).  However, GRS 1915 has displayed variability classes consistently since its discovery in 1992, implying that the two classes seen only in IGR J17091 are either completely absent in GRS 1915 or that they occur with a much lower probability.  In either case, this implies physical differences between methods of generating GRS 1915-like variability in the two objects.  
\par As noted in sections \ref{sec:DisI} to \ref{sec:DisIX}, variability classes seen in both IGR J17091 and GRS 1915 show differences in the different objects.  In particular, we note the presence of irregular flares in Class IX which are not seen in the analogous Class $\gamma$.  If these classes are indeed generated by the same processes in both objects, the differences between them must represent physical differences between the objects themselves.
\par It has previously been noted that, while the hardness ratios in IGR J17091 and GRS 1915 during $\rho$-like classes are different, the fractional hardening between the dip and peak of each flare is consistent with being the same in both objects \citep{Capitanio_peculiar}.  This suggests that the same physical process is behind the `heartbeats' seen in both objects.
\par We note the presence of hysteretic HID$_1$ loops in some classes of both objects.  Although these loops are always clockwise in GRS 1915, they can be executed in either direction in IGR J17091.  Classes in IGR J17091 that show loops all have a preferred loop direction: anticlockwise in Classes III and IV and clockwise in classes V, VI, VII and VIII.  In cases where the loop direction was opposite to that expected for a given class, loop detections were generally only marginally significant.  In particular, we note that Classes IV and V tend to show loops in opposite directions, despite the similarities between their lightcurves and the $\rho$, $\nu$ and $\mu$ classes in GRS 1915.   The fact that IGR J17091 can show HID$_1$ loops in both directions suggests that an increase in soft emission can either precede or lag a correlated increase in hard emission from IGR J17091.  Whether soft emission precedes or lags hard emission is in turn is dependent on the variability class.
\par There are also non-trivial similarities between variability in the two objects.  We note the presence of a $\sim5$Hz QPO in many of the classes seen in IGR J17091, and this same 5Hz QPO is seen in lightcurves of GRS 1915.  Similarly \citet{Altamirano_HFQPO} reported the discovery of a 66Hz QPO in IGR J17091; a very similar frequency to the 67Hz QPO observed in GRS 1915 \citep{Morgan_QPO}.  It is not clear why these QPOs would exist at roughly the same frequencies in both objects when other variability in IGR J17091 tend to be faster.

\subsection{Comparison with the Rapid Burster}

\par In 2015, \citet{Bagnoli_RB} discovered the existence of two GRS 1915-like variability classes in the neutron star binary MXB 1730-335, also known as the `Rapid Burster'.  Specifically, \citet{Bagnoli_RB} note the presence of variability similar to Classes $\rho$ and $\theta$ in GRS 1915.
\par Class $\theta$-like variability, seen in \textit{RXTE}\ observation 92026-01-20-02 of the Rapid Burster, is not closely matched by any of the classes we identify for IGR J17091.  However, the lightcurves of a Class $\theta$ observation feature large dips in count rate similar to those seen in Classes VI and VIII in IGR J17091.
\par Conversely, Class $\rho$-like variability is seen in all three objects.  \citet{Bagnoli_RB} note that the variability of the $\rho$-like flaring is slower in the Rapid Burster than in either GRS 1915 or IGR J17091. It has previously been suggested that the maximum rate of flaring in LMXBs should be inversely proportional to the mass of the central object (e.g. \citealp{Belloni_Timescales,Frank_Timescales}).  In this case, the fact that variability is faster in IGR J17091 than in GRS 1915 could simply be due to a lower black hole mass in the former object \citep{Altamirano_IGR_FH}.  However if variability in the Rapid Burster is assumed to be physically analogous to variability in these two black hole objects, then we note that a correlation between central object mass and variability timescale no longer holds.

\subsection{Comparison with Altamirano \textit{et al.} 2011}

\label{sec:Alta}
\par \citet{Altamirano_IGR_FH} identify 5 GRS 1915 variability classes in a subset of observations from the 2011-2013 outburst of IGR J17091: six of these observations are presented in Table \ref{tab:me_Diego} along with the best-fit GRS 1915 class that we assign it in this paper (see also Table \ref{tab:class_assign}).

\begin{table}

\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\par We acknowledge differences between the classifications assigned by this paper and by \citet{Altamirano_IGR_FH}.  We ascribe these differences to the different approaches we have used to construct our classes.  In particular while we have constructed an independent set of variability classes for IGR J17091 which we have then compared to the \citeauthor{Belloni_GRS_MI} classes for GRS 1915, \citeauthor{Altamirano_IGR_FH} applied the \citeauthor{Belloni_GRS_MI} classes for GRS 1915 directly to IGR J17091.
\par In general, the variability classes we find to be present in IGR J17091 are broadly the same as those noted by \citet{Altamirano_IGR_FH}.  We do not associate any class with Class $\alpha$ in GRS 1915, but we find examples of all of the other variability classes posited by \citeauthor{Altamirano_IGR_FH} to exist in IGR J17091.
\par \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH} noted the presence of an anticlockwise loop in the HID of `heartbeat'-like observations of IGR J17091, opposed to the clockwise loop seen in HID of $\rho$-class observations of GRS 1915.  This is consistent with our finding that hysteretic loops in classes III and IV also tend to execute in an anticlockwise direction.  However, we additionally find that hysteretic loops in classes V, VI, VII and VIII tend to execute in a clockwise direction.  This is also different from GRS 1915, in which the loop is executed in the same direction in all classes.  We also additionally report that clockwise loops tend to be more complex than anticlockwise loops seen in IGR J17091, with many showing a multi-lobed structure not seen in GRS 1915.  This apparent inconsistency between the objects strengthens the suggestion in \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH} that the heartbeat-like classes in GRS 1915 and IGR J17091 may be generated by physically different mechanisms.

\subsection{New Constraints on Accretion Rate, Mass \& Distance}
\label{sec:newmass}

\par The constraints that \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH} placed on the mass and distance of IGR J17091 assumed that the object emitted at its Eddington luminosity at the peak of the 2011--2013 outburst.  They report a peak 2--50\,keV flux of $4\times10^{-9}$\,ergs~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$\ during flares in `heartbeat'-like lightcurves during this time.  The correction factor $C_{Bol,Peak}$ to convert 2--50\,keV flux to bolometric flux is not well constrained, but \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH} suggest an order-of-magnitude estimate of $\lesssim3$, corresponding to a peak bolometric flux of $\lesssim1.2\times10^{-8}$\,ergs~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ .
\par \citealp{Maccarone_2pct} performed a study of the soft to hard transitions in 10 LMXBs.  They found that all but one perform this transition at a luminosity consistent with between 1\% and 4\% of the Eddington limit.  We use \textit{Swift} observation 00031921058 taken on MJD 55965 to create a spectrum of IGR J17091 during the approximate time of its transition from a soft to a hard state \citep{Drave_Return}.  We fit this spectrum above 2\,keV with a power-law, and extrapolate to find a 2--50\,keV flux of $8.56\times10^{-10}$\,ergs~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ .  Assuming that the transition bolometric correction factor $C_{Bol,Tran}$ is also $\lesssim3$, this corresponds to a bolometric flux of $\lesssim2.5\times10^{-9}$\,ergs~s$^{-1}$~cm$^{-2}$ .
\par By comparing this with the results of \citealp{Maccarone_2pct} and \citealp{Altamirano_IGR_FH}, we find that IGR J17091-3624 was likely emitting at no more than $\sim5$--20\% of its Eddington Limit at its peak.  This number becomes $\sim6\mbox{--}25$\% if we instead use $C_{Bol,Tran}=2.4$, or $\sim8\mbox{--}33$\% if $C_{Bol,Tran}=1.8$.  With this new range of values, we are able to re-derive the compact object mass as the function of the distance (Figure \ref{fig:IGRMass}).  We find that for a black hole mass of $\sim10$M$_\odot$ , as suggested by \citealp{Iyer_Bayes}, IGR J17091 is within the galaxy at a distance of 6--17\,kpc.  This is consistent with the estimated distance of $\sim11\mbox{--}17$\,kpc estimated by \citealp{Rodriguez_D} for a compact object mass of 10M$_\odot$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Implications for Models of `Heartbeat' Variability}

\par We have found that hysteretic HID loops can execute in both directions in IGR J17091 (e.g. Section \ref{sec:Alta}), as well as found a revised estimate that IGR J17091 accretes at $\lesssim20$\% Eddington (Section \ref{sec:newmass}).  Both of these findings have implications for physical models of GRS 1915-like variability in this source.
\par Firstly, we find that Eddington-limited accretion is neither necessary nor sufficient for GRS 1915-like variability.  The discovery of GRS 1915-like variability in the sub-Eddington Rapid Burster \citep{Bagnoli_RB,Bagnoli_PopStudy} provided the first evidence that Eddington-limited accretion may not be a driving factor in this type of variability.  We strengthen this case by finding that IGR J17091-3624 is also likely sub-Eddington.  As such, we further rule out any scenario in which Eddington-limited accretion is required for GRS 1915-like variability in black hole LMXBs specifically.
\par Secondly, by using the direction of hysteretic HID loops, we find that hard photon lag in `heartbeat'-like classes of IGR J17091 can be either positive or negative.  This could mean that we must rule out the causal connection between soft and hard emission being common to all classes.
\par In either case, we find that scenarios that require high global accretion rates or predict a consistent hard photon lag (e.g. \citealp{Neilsen_GRSModel,Janiuk_Lag}), are not able to explain GRS 1915-like variability in IGR J17091 unless they also feature geometric obscuration in a subset of variability classes.  We note that simulations by \citealp{Nayakshin_GRSModel} require an Eddington fraction of $\gtrsim0.26$ before GRS 1915-like variability, a value which falls in the range $\sim0.05\mbox{--}0.33$ that we find for the peak Eddington fraction of IGR J17091.
\par In addition to being near its Eddington limit GRS 1915 also has the largest orbit of any known LMXB (e.g. \citealp{McClintock_BHBs}).  \citealp{Sadowski_MagField} have also shown that thin, radiation dominated regions of disks in LMXBs require a large-scale threaded magnetic field to be stable, and the field strength required to stabilise such a disk in GRS 1915 is higher than for any other LMXB they studied.  We suggest that one of these parameters is more likely to be the criterion for GRS 1915-like variability.  If better constraints can be placed on the disk size and minimum stabilising field strength in IGR J17091, it will become clear whether either of these parameters can be the unifying factor behind LMXBs that display GRS 1915-like variability.

\section{Conclusions}

\par We have constructed the first model-independent set of variability classes for the entire portion of the 2011--2013 outburst of IGR J17091 that was observed with \textit{RXTE} .  We find that the data are well-described by a set of 9 classes;  7 of these appear to have direct counterparts in GRS 1915, while two are, so far, unique to IGR J17091.  We find that variability in IGR J17091 is generally faster than in the corresponding classes of GRS 1915, and that patterns of quasi-periodic flares and dips form the basis of most variability in both objects.  Despite this, we find evidence that `heartbeat'-like variability in both objects may be generated by different physical processes.  In particular, while hard photons always lag soft in GRS 1915, we find evidence that hard photons can lag or precede soft photons in IGR J17091 depending on the variability class.
\par We also report on the long-term evolution of the 2011--2013 outburst of IGR J17091, in particular noting the presence of 3 re-flares during the later part of the outburst.  Using an empirical relation between hard-soft transition luminosity and Eddington luminosity \citep{Maccarone_2pct}, we estimate that IGR J17091 was likely accreting at no greater than $\sim33$\% of its Eddington limit at peak luminosity.
\par We use these result to conclude that any model of GRS 1915-like variability which requires a near-Eddington global accretion rate is insufficient to explain the variability we see in IGR J17091.  As such we suggest that an extreme value of some different parameter, such as disk size or minimum stabilising large-scale magnetic field, may be the unifying factor behind all objects which display GRS 1915-like variability.  This would explain why sub-Eddington sources such as IGR J17091 and the Rapid Burster do display GRS 1915-like variability, while other Eddington-limited sources such as GX 17+2 and V404 Cyg do not.

"H. L. Loucks writes about his desire to be involved in politics at the national level. He mentions Richard O. Richards will continue his work with the primary law amendments and Loucks believes he will be an ally in the elections. He suggests that Pettigrew should contact progressive leaders throughout the United States.
Jan. 20th. 1915.
I continue to gain physically, and as I do, with no business cares, I feel it in more and more strongly, that I should get busy somehow, somewhere in advocating our national principles.
The Administration is making lots of ammunition, that is practically going to waste for want of attention. The reactionary republicans will control, and will limit their campaign to the tariff largely. The time to expose those things is when there is no direct campaign on. We should in some way have an understanding with and a plan of national cooperation. So far as this state is concerned that work must devolve largely upon you. Richards will concentrate on his primary law amendments, but I have no doubt will work with us when we are ready. Now so far as The Progressive Party is concerned, I stand just where I advised you before election I would, but could not, without being misunderstood take that position publicly.
I can and will be glad to cooperate with the true progressives.
I would not trust the men in this state who deserted us for Johnson, but there is no necessity of making that public at present.
So far as the National organization, I could not cooperate with them so long as they are financed and controlled by Perkins.
Now the thing for you to find out first is, as to what extent after the prominent desertions of the McCormicks, can Perkins control the national organization. Roosevelt will go with Perkins I think.
At any rate in the Pinchot discussion he so affirmed very emphatically, and in any case I think that he should be deposed as ROSS.
But I did not seem to have time on any of my trips. I did stop over between trains to have a visit with the editor of “The Public” and was very much pleased with both him and his good wife.
Get in touch with Johnson of California, and while in Washington with Kent and other Washington (crossed out) California Progressives. Poindexter and The Washington delegation. Kegley of the Washington State Grange is a very strong man there and I will take it up with him.
The Pinchots of course and find out how New York & Penn? are likely to go in National convention. Clapp of Minn. May have to take his chances in the republican ranks again. Like what I have seen of him. Now if that group will cooperate with us for a straight, clean cut, advanced platform that would simplify matters a great deal but if not, then I think that it would be better for us to organize this state and wait.developments.
In the meantime if I only had expense money to pay for stationary, printing and postage, I would begin another series of one column articles and furnish to as many of the papers in the state as would use them, and begin a systematic movement to enlist earnest men in the several counties. This would necessitate personal visits, and prepare the way for personal work later if we can start a regular Paper, as you have suggested.
I wish that you would have a good, visit with LaFollette and learn what his plans are for the future. I am satisfied that he is more inclined to independent action than he was. Still his political life is evidently at stake in Wisconsin. Having supported the Progressive candidate for Governor, and I think for Senator I am not sure, but it is going to complicate matters very much for him.
There is a great deal to do, and now is the time to begin.",http://accessarchives.sdstate.edu/index.php/correspondence-102
"Mediocrity, an author said some decades ago, is fatal. Its uninspiring ways, easy ground to craft excuses, make it opium for all sloths and unambitious folks. Pop culture, anecdotal evidence, and a cultural understanding have backed the mandate that being average is a blemish on personality.
Think of the ideas we’re programmed to go up against: how to be “most successful,” “most popular,” most… anything. The superlative to existence must be a constant state, and falling short raises questions about ambition and merit.
But there are people (well, people like me) who wear this “blemish” with pride. “I love to learn but I’m not the most brilliant person. I like to write but that doesn’t mean I’m the greatest writer. I’m just kind of plain,” wrote Canadian national and fellow mediocrity-embracer Krista O’Reilly Davi-Digui in a recent blog.
“What if I am mediocre and choose to be at peace with that?” she asked.
There is some merit to being average, to feeling okay with being at an arm’s distance from the “bests” and the “greats.” For one, it is a way to resist this perceived tyranny of excellence, as two researchers from the University of Oxford note. In 2018, they presented a paper on “kakonomics” based on the Greek word κακός (‘kakós’) which means “bad.” According to them, people consciously and unconsciously desire to achieve a mediocre or a low-quality result as a way of distancing themselves from popular ideas about success.
Think of the multiple critiques of perfectionism or meritocracy; the idea that excellence is parochial and outdated, and designed to uplift those in privileged positions.
Overall, it is safe to say mediocrity is underrated. Maybe it’s because we like to live in extremes. If anything, there’s no human conditioning more natural than being average, the semblance of balance comes across best in the world of average people. Greatness may be measured in extremes, but in the realm of mediocrity, there’s a chance to critique who measures greatness in the first place.
Plus, mediocrity exists in peace with good mental health. The pursuit of excellence inevitably hijacks a world of peace and leisure; it is hard to escape it, and we’re resolved to proving the many ways in which we’re special and unique at all times.
Being satisfied is often dismissed as complacency, as a diametric reality to hustle culture that celebrates wanting and wanting more. Where does the buck stop, if at all? There’s so much resonance with this fatigue that there’s even a term for it: “toxic motivation.” The idea of “killing yourself” for the glory of success is deeply rooted in ableist notions of productivity. It’s no wonder that when we all feel average in our own little ways during the pandemic–unable to work a lot, unable to do anything, actually–the burnout is worse.
Instead, even a mundane world could be normal. Safety, comfort, a blase lifestyle associated with “mediocre” people have the potential to be desirable. The word in itself is wrapped in an aura of inferiority, but claiming it and finding peace in it could take a stab at the criticism.
Despite its public image, ambition is very personal. It’s defined by experiences and context and means different things to different people. For instance, “every healthy human body is capable of climbing mountains and swinging from trees, and even walking on our hands! But how many of us ever do? More importantly, how many of us even want to?” Balachandran added.
Fictional and real-life accounts have carved heroes that embody perfection to serve our aspirations. The glorious tales of billionaire-turned-superhero Batman– the child prodigy who runs a business empire while saving the world at night. (Have we all forgotten that his entire story rests on the foundation of trauma? His “excellence” cost him everything.) These seemingly perfect people are meant to inspire others to rise above their own mediocrity. But this reality is a little disingenuous.
Mark Manson likened the idea of “overachievers” not being a norm to that of a bell curve. The curve gets really thin at the far ends of any graph; meaning there are very few people who are either really good at something or really bad at it. The rest of us fall back into mediocrity. We’re all kakós in our own ways.
This is not to say that those of us who embrace mediocrity have no desires or don’t see ourselves living a certain way, trying to better at things. We simply take the pressure off our shoulders with the time-honored tool of acceptance. It is in the pursuit of something, of meaning or purpose, that we do things. Rather than feeling like we need to be extraordinary — to be the Da Vinci of painting or Kobe Bryant of basketball — the effort has to be on finding what works for us, and feeling at peace with the result of mediocrity.
Whatever a mediocre person does, then, is for themselves. They may do it just for the joy of it and by that logic, are less tied to its outcome. Mediocrity is a celebration of personal choice and individuality. The acceptance of your limitations may liberate you.
Take a deep breath and say it with me: I am mediocre, and I love it.

"“Congratulations.” Chelsea went down the small hallway that led to the office. Beyond it was the stairway down to the special rooms that Justin was renovating. She smiled as she remembered the glory hole session with Prudence, and knocked brightly at the office door.
“You’re so sweet, Shelly. Really. What would I do without you?” The older woman rested her head on the younger woman’s chest. The younger woman held her and patted her back. Shortly, they broke the embrace and Prudence drained the pasta thoroughly before adding it to the sauce.
“Where did you get the pasta?” Chelsea asked.
“Made it myself. A hobby of mine, and one of the few kitchen tricks I taught Justin how to do. He’s gotten rather proud of his homemade pasta, and it’s doing great business at his restaurant, but I’ll stack mine up against his any day. Try a little.” She proffered a triangle that Chelsea bit immediately.
Prudence smiled wanly. “Of course, my dear. You’re so kind.” A moment’s tossing of the pan and a quick mix of the salad found dinner on the table. Both women relished it with the fruity red wine and had seconds of everything. After the meal, they quickly washed up, stowed the leftovers and retired to the living room with glasses of port.
“Not much to tell, really.” Prudence took another sip of port. “At least, not much that was good. Growing up was a horror. My father was in International Law, and he spent twenty five years in Washington at the embassy. That’s where my brother Armand, me and my sister Clarissa were born. My mother was a genteel woman, delicately schooled in the domestic arts, subservient, never caused a fuss. My father was had a terrible temper and treated his family like dirt. My brother was a god: he could do nothing wrong, and he got away with everything. My little sister was a shrew, and the most like my father in the family. I was most like my mother and I got most of the blame for whatever when wrong. When I was thirteen years old, my father started abusing me twice a week with my mother’s permission, beating me as well as invading my body. I was devastated by that, and my sister always took out her anger on me as well, making me feel so inadequate that I accepted my fate quietly. It got worse when I was fifteen and started to find myself attracted to other girls in school; most of them ran from me, but Hilary was the first to love me for who I am. My parents found out, and punished me severely, my father screaming that he would make me fit to be wife and started screwing me three times a week. My sister took the opportunity to tease me subtly in public, and torture me sexually at night in our room alone.
“I got out of there as soon as I could after I graduated from high school. I went as far as I could for college, out to Berkeley in California, where I first felt that I fit into a group. Being bilingual was a big advantage in library work, and I loved the stillness of the stacks, as well as the chance to help people learn something. My sister followed me there two years later: I loved my little sister dearly and my parents asked me to look after her. We roomed together, and she made my life a wreck during the week, while running away weekends for wild parties. Such secrets I had to keep from my parents: Clarissa loved both women and men, making them serve her needs like a mother hen. She married Franklin D’Enfer because he was a promising young man with lots of money, and he was her favorite man in bed at the time.
“She was the first to introduce me to masochism, trained me to see pain as pleasure, then she abandoned me. I tried to find a husband, but my heart was such a wreck that I could never accept kindness from a man, never see a future with one. My brother was killed in a police action in Central Africa in my mid-twenties; my parents’ lives unraveled after that. My father started drinking heavily and died in an auto accident six months after Armand’s death; my mother developed cancer and submitted to it a year later. The library was my only refuge and the skills my mother taught me when I was little and beloved were my solace.
“Clarissa got me this job at the library all those years ago when she was pregnant with Justine. She wanted me to be close by so she wouldn’t need to hire a babysitter, and over the years she would dump the children on me without warning, for any length of time. They were joys when they were little, Justine and Justin: dear, sweet, loving. My body became fat like my mother’s and Clarissa’s stayed thin like my father’s and my grandmother’s on that side, so no one became interested in me sexually. I knew everything that Clarissa was doing, she made sure I knew every detail of her sordid life, but I fooled myself that I could protect the children from their parents by giving them a healthy home away from home. When Franklin and Clarissa had to leave the country, I felt I had my chance, but Justine turned out to be just like her mother and she found how to lead me back to my taste for warped pleasure. The sensations drove me out of control, and the attention she gave me was like finding a lost lover. Justin is such a good boy, and he took her place rather innocently trying to make me happy. I’m so ashamed, I feel that I’ve used him as the husband I never had; I let him do anything to me he wanted and served his every want.
Chelsea’s eyes were overflowing, and her head came down to sob on Prudence’s shoulder. Prudence cried as well, as they huddled on the couch. After a while, Chelsea pulled back. “You shouldn’t think of yourself like that, Prudy. You were only doing what you had to. Justine and Justin are so dear you’d do anything for them, even commit incest with them because you want to make them happy. The things you do aren’t that all right, but your heart sure is. We’ve both lost something deep in our lives: my father and I were güvenilir bahis siteleri alone in the world. He’s one of the white sheep of the D’Enfer family, and after my mother died, he’s never looked at another woman. He brought me up as best he could, made me feel like his princess, and encouraged me to be whatever I wanted to be. It was still a lonely childhood: I couldn’t make friends easily, was shy and embarrassed around boys, and girls never accepted my interest either. Then dad died in that accident over here last year while I was in college, and I was alone in the world. I fell in love with art, and when I found out that Justine was coming to Europe, I was eager to discover more family.
“At first, we were just innocents abroad, then we discovered a forbidden flame for each other. One morning I woke up and Justine’s head was on my shoulder and she looked so lovely. I kissed her forehead to awaken her and she responded by kissing my lips. Hormones started running wild, and soon we were honeymooners together. I loved her so much, it hurt, we were bound closer than sisters, friends. We had adventures, got taken in a couple of times, particularly by Uncle Fred, the worst of the lot, and it came time for me to come back here. Justin is the first boy I’ve slept with: he’s everything I ever wanted in a man. Just this evening, I sneaked down to the club behind Justine’s back and we fucked so hard because I haven’t seen him for two weeks and Justine’s not really taking good care of him. I’ve kidded myself that cousins marrying isn’t uncommon in history and someday I could land him and we three could live in an orgiastic playground that would last forever.
Chelsea gripped Prudence fiercely and kissed her hard on the lips. They writhed and ground their mouths into each other’s, parting momentarily to pant and breathe before locking lips again. Their embrace became frantic, it was as though they were wrestling rather than hugging, tearing at each other’s clothing and they sank to the floor, pushing aside the end table to create enough room for them to lie together on the carpeted space. Their hands pawed each other’s breasts roughly, smashing and pinching them, squeezing them, before their hands went together to invade each other’s valleys of desire. Their lips remained in their fierce lock as their hands probed each other’s genitalia, eventually pulsing together with three fingers inserted in each other’s vaginas, their nipples dancing damp circles around one another’s in close contact.  When Chelsea came down from her high, she dove headfirst to lock her lips on Prudence’s clitoris and within ninety seconds Prudence was writhing out of control in her own orgasm.
They settled down, lying together on the floor, the aromas of passion drifting up from where they soaked the carpet. Prudence stroked Chelsea’s jaw line and cheek; Chelsea traced the curves of Prudence’s breast and nipple. Their eyes look deep into one another’s and they moved their legs so their clitorises touched.",http://aiporn.info/the-family-denfer-redux-ch-09.html
"What Is a Task Danger Evaluation?
A task threat analysis will recognize any kind of task danger that exists and also the linked danger that can take place. An effective analysis will consider the kind of job being done, workers, tools, environments, and any other elements that might be present or likely to exist. You need to recognize what kind of dangers exist as well as where they are located. A firm has various risk evaluation departments for various work. These divisions concentrate on certain areas and also dangers in order to provide the most total picture for their clients. The first step of a job risk evaluation is a review of the work summary. You need to recognize the feature and also any special demands of the task might have. The dangers of that specific task need to be thoroughly recognized. You must find out the regularity of occurrences, their severity, as well as the results of each occurrence on the persons performing the tasks entailed. Based on your findings, you then have to contrast the work danger evaluation results with the standard operating procedures set out by OSHA. When you know the certain threats, you can compare the guidelines with your own knowledge and experience. By this time, you should have determined several key areas for extra study. Among the most effective ways to do this is with recognition of threats on-site. Throughout an examination of the on-site location, you can recognize dangers at work website and review them in regards to exactly how they influence the employees. This details is important in both establishing a strategy for safety as well as additionally comparing the hazard evaluations with the demands in the standard. After you have identified threats on-site, you need to compare your task threat analysis results with those of the sector standards. Criterion assessments should always be compared to your own. You might locate that certain elements of the standard are not as poor as you originally believed. As an example, if a chemical that you determine as being a safety and security danger is listed in a different area of the basic than an additional chemical, it can indicate a considerable difference between the two. An additional integral part of the job threat analysis is contrasting the conditions experienced by the worker with the problems experienced under normal problems at the workplace. An employee may be put in a risky circumstance for reasons other than his knowledge or lack of ability to carry out specific jobs. If he is operating in conditions that are clearly above the degree of his capacity, after that he is plainly in danger of having crashes. Because of this, you must contrast the worker’s experience under regular and risky problems and identify prospective dangers in the specific task function. This can be done by noting the most regularly done jobs in each section as well as reviewing their results on the worker. The third action of creating a job danger list entails thinking about the possible effects of the recognized threats on the atmosphere as well as people. This step entails assessing the impact of the risk on people, and also how most likely these individuals are to experience injury or ailment if they work in the area covered by the threat. On top of that, you will certainly need to take into consideration the likelihood of mishaps happening in the area. This consists of considering the probability that a crash will certainly cause damage to an individual, the quantity of harm that can be triggered to an individual in case of a mishap, and also the level of residential property damages that can be created in the event of a crash. Finally, you will certainly require to consider any type of price implications related to your danger evaluation.",http://airmaxclearancesale.us/3-tips-from-someone-with-experience-25/
"(ATLANTA - November 29, 2010) The nationally syndicated cable television History Channel has made the controversial decision to force cable television companies, including Comcast and Charter, to pull ads paid for by the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Georgia commemorating the Sesquicentennial (150th Anniversary) of the War Between the States.
The series of twelve television commercials by the Sons of Confederate Veterans is part of a statewide radio and television campaign aimed at commemorating the anniversary of the late War Between the States and educating the public on Georgia's important role and the historical causes of the War. All twelve television commercials, as well as a companion series of radio commercials, are still broadcasting across the state of Georgia; and an entire slate of additional commercials are already in production for 2011.
The commercials came under scrutiny of the History Channel when a little-known liberal Internet site began attacking the Sons of Confederate Veterans for commemorating the War and, subsequently, also the History Channel for allowing the commercials to broadcast in their programming.
Vice-president Nancy Alpert of A&E Television, the parent company of the History Channel, gave the following explanation of her decision to ban the historical ads: ""The subject matter of each of the SCV ads, plus the actual language... is well beyond our guidelines for any advertising on AETN."" Alpert cited her opinion that the ads violated History Channel guidelines by quoting, among other things, a statement in one commercial that the war was ""Not a 'civil war' fought to take over the United States, as it is called in history books today, this was a war... against an aggressive invasion by federal troops."" She also complained that one of the commercials related to the causes of the War stated that the South seceded in part because ""Northern congressmen were able to vote themselves virtually anything they wanted, using Southern tax money, while the South was powerless to stop it.""
The commercials clearly offer a different point of view than that which is usually presented by documentaries on the History Channel; yet the channel has purported in the past to be an outlet which offers competing, and even controversial, opinions about historical events. Speaking on behalf of the Georgia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans which paid for the commercials to run, Division Commander Jack Bridwell had this to say, ""We find it more than interesting that the History Channel has no problem airing shows with controversial theories about history, including more than one show which speculates that extraterrestrial aliens in UFO's somehow redirected human history, and yet the same channel does not see the value in allowing a non-profit, educational organisation to present the Southern view of the causes for the War.""
As the organisation founded in 1896 and directly descended from the original United Confederate Veterans, the Sons of Confederate Veterans is charged in their initial charter with teaching the historical reasons for the South's heroic stand against overwhelming odds in the War. The charge given at the organisation's founding states, ""To you, Sons of Confederate Veterans, we will submit the vindication of the cause for which we fought; To your strength will be given the defense of the Confederate soldier's good name, the guardianship of his history, the emulation of his virtues, and the perpetuation of those principles he loved and which made him glorious and which you also cherish.""
With the Sons of Confederate Veterans representing more than 100,000 Southerners across the country, the Georgia Division of the SCV announced today that it is launching a campaign to educate the general American public about the censorship and hypocrisy of the A&E Network and particularly the History Channel. It is estimated that the A&E Network stands to lose several hundred thousand dollars over the course of the next two quarters as their advertisers are barraged by former viewers who are unhappy with this pandering to ""political correctness,"" particularly across the South.

"Healing from the inside out will last for an eternity. That’s a comforting thought, isn’t it?
Many movies or TV shows involved characters being locked up in a prison. When a prisoner misbehaves, they can be sent to solitary confinement. They might be left alone with no human contact for days, weeks, or in extreme cases a few months.
Solitary confinement is not only a physically deprived environment, but it’s also an emotionally and mentally deprived one too. God made us to need social interaction. But it’s unlikely you’ll receive love exactly the way you want it and exactly when you want it.
Healthy relationships have significant amounts of closeness and separation. Both extremes end up being obstacles to emotional growth.   A healthy person develops a sense of identity so they can function independently of others.
However, too much separation is no good either. With thick walls, a person won’t feel hurt by someone else. Unfortunately, the walls can become like a prison that fosters loneliness among other negative consequences.
Imagine you are in a room all alone. There are no windows or doors. It’s completely dark. No one can get in to hurt you, but neither can anyone get in to help. This is actually a good analogy for learning how to receive help.
The people on the outside have little, if any, control over what happens on the inside. All they can see is the wall you’ve put up. No one can “fix” another person without their cooperation.
On the inside, it’s possible to make a door and even open it. Any openings you allow can only be locked from the inside. You can lock others out, but they can’t lock you in. You can unlock the door, but they can’t.
What happens though if you lose the key to your door? That makes healing more complicated. Perhaps your “door” has been locked so long that you don’t remember how to connect with others. Then, fearing the unknown, you are reluctant to bother to look for the key.
People on the outside might sense your struggle, but there’s no way for them to unlock the door.  You’re so confused you don’t remember how to open up. 
When you’re trapped inside–that’s mental illness. That’s hopelessness that leads to even more severe depression and anxiety.
How much do you identify with feeling trapped like this? How long have you suffered from loneliness? It’s so easy to be trapped in a double bind. It doesn’t feel safe to stay locked up, but neither does it feel safe to open up. You desperately need help but help feels too intrusive.
Even in this situation, there is hope. God only needs your permission, then He can get inside without a key or even a door. God can bring order to the chaos inside of you. God can bring clarity. God brings understanding. God can help you open a window.
God waits with His healing touch for us to desire to let Him in. Healing can only happen from the inside out. But a window lets light through both ways.
Ask Jesus to help you open the door of your heart so others’ lights can encourage you and your light can encourage them.
Read more about healing.
For the lost in the depressive state who is trying, does God ever come through without knocking? I believe God can and does do all things and calls His elect to Him. We will have no day or part in it. It will just happen. I am going through everything you detailed in this and I truly am thankful for the truth in it.
That’s a good question. Working out life is always a cooperative effort between God and us. We do all we can do and then let God do all He can do.
God made us to fit with Him. A believer has the Holy Spirit living within, so I don’t know it’s necessary for God to formally knock all the time. Like any relationship, it all depends on preferences and agreements. You might tell one friend they can come over any time, but others you might want them to call first. The Christian has been bought with a price. God owns everything. We owe our health to God. It makes sense to me that he’d be welcome anytime. See 1 Corinthians 6:19-20.
The knocking is certainly true for the unbeliever who is an enemy to God. See James 4:4.
The believers’ spirits welcome God. But in the flesh, we can block out God with an unrepentant heart. It is our responsibility to surrender to God. God promises to forgive, restore, and establish. See 1 Peter 5:10.",http://christianconcepts.com/heavenly-healing-from-the-inside-out/
"I have seen wonderful images taken at Bosque del Apache (“Woods of the Apache”) by various wildlife photographers over the years but I was not prepared for what I was about to experience. Maybe is was the light, maybe the time of year, possibly my mood, but this is one of the most astonishingly beautiful and inspiring places I have ever seen.
I was immediately enchanted by the landscape and knew this had to be recorded and printed in color. I had one evening with the setting sun and the next morning with clouds and drizzle to photograph and in both circumstances the colors of the grasses held lovely color saturation.
Bosque is a “forest” of grasses, trees, water and of course the abundant wildlife. I was overwhelmed by the colors....very “winterish” in appearance...everything from deep rusts to bright yellow grasses. The leafless trees had a deep brown to blackish bark which stood in contrast to the rest of the scenery. These jpgs don’t do the amazingly delicate detail it’s due.

"XI'AN, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic women's quadruple sculls champions eased to the win despite rain on Saturday, while other teams ""have made great improvement"" in their eyes during the rowing competition at China's 14th National Games in Yangling, Shaanxi Province.
""Technology contributes a lot to the development of rowing in China,"" said Luo Chen, from the Chinese Rowing Association.
According to Luo, a biomechanical system installed on training boats can monitor data such as each athlete's stroke frequency and strength, as well as the angle and depth of their oars in the water.
""If the strength on the left side is weaker than the other, athletes can make instant adjustments to ensure the boat always moves perfectly straight,"" Luo said.
Coaches also analyze data and compare with those of the world's best rowers, and make specific training plans.
""All athletes on the boat will move towards one standard, and the result is that they are faster in achieving perfect cooperation,"" said Luo.
This is part of the reason why Olympic rowing champions Chen Yunxia, Zhang Ling, Lyu Yang and Cui Xiaotong, who received different training modes before, can always cooperate perfectly.
High-tech also plays a key role in optimizing talents selection and cultivation.
Su Hui was selected as a rower when he was 13 years old, with the only reason being that he was ""tall with long legs"". Nowadays, physiological and biochemical indexes of athletes, such as maximum oxygen uptake, will be collected before they are selected to be members of a rowing team.
""Apart from height and muscles, these indexes are quite important in judging whether a person can be an Olympic champion or not,"" Su said. ""It's really accurate.""
According to Su, they used to believe that more training would equal more achievements, and that getting injured due to too much training was nothing strange.
At the National Games, however, indexes of all rowing athletes are collected at least once a week.
""We do this and adjust their intensity of training accordingly so as to be more efficient and prevent athletes from getting injured,"" Su explained.
During the intervals between games, athletes keep training on rowing machines. ""The machine has been upgraded and helps us a lot in improving our core strength, which is the basis for being a good rower,"" said Ren Jiaqi, a rower from the Guangdong team.
To make China's rowing faster, the nation's sports department has cooperated with universities to develop some high-tech products, such as anti-drug coatings for boats to reduce resistance in water, and smart plates that can accurately display the calories in food to help rowers eat more healthily.
This is also the first time for Olympic teams to compete in the National Games along with domestic opponents.
""This is a great chance for us to learn more from Olympians,"" said Liu Hang, a coach from Henan's team. ""Apart from their honorable spirit and advanced training methods, we also found they utilize high-tech to empower their training, and we will learn from this.""",http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0919/c90000-9898609.html
"Will a Living Trust Meet Your Needs?
Ask people why they work hard and save their money, and often you'll hear that it's not only because they want to raise their own standard of living--they want to leave something behind for their children, too. Understandably, they don't want a big chunk of that money to be used up for probate lawyers' fees or death taxes.
That's where living trusts come in. They don't save you a penny while you're alive, but after death they can eliminate the need for probate--and probate fees--and they can also reduce or eliminate federal estate (death) tax. More of the property you leave goes to the people you want to inherit it.
But there is a confusing variety of living trusts. Most people aren't exactly sure how they work or who needs them. And paying a lawyer to explain it all may leave you more in the dark--not to mention poorer--than when you started.
Here's a rundown of the basics, so you can decide whether or not you need a living trust and if so, what kind.
a basic living trust (for an individual or couple), which avoids probate.
""living trust with marital life estate"" or ""A-B"" trust, which both avoids probate and saves on estate tax.
Unless you expect to owe federal estate tax at your death or your spouse's, a basic living trust to avoid probate may be all the trust you need. It allows property to avoid probate and to pass to the beneficiaries you name quickly and efficiently, without the hassles and expense of probate court proceedings.
To create a basic living trust, you (called the grantor or settler) transfer ownership of some or all of your property to the living trust. Because you make yourself the ""trustee,"" you don't give up any control over the property you put in trust. If you and your spouse create a trust together, you will be co-trustees.
In the trust document, you name the people or institutions you want to inherit trust property after your death. You can change those choices if you wish; you can also revoke the trust at any time.
First, the good news: Most people don't need to think about federal estate taxes, which kick in only when someone dies owning more than $625,000 to $1 million worth of property, depending on the year of your death. But if you (or you and your spouse) expect to own that much property, consider creating a living trust that will both avoid probate and also save on federal estate taxes.
If you don't, there may be a big estate tax bill when the second spouse dies. That's because the survivor's estate includes his or her share of the couple's property plus the property inherited from the deceased spouse.
If you can't leave your spouse property without also saddling his or her estate with a large tax bill, one obvious alternative is to leave much of your property directly to your children or other beneficiaries. But most people want to provide financial security for the surviving spouse--which may not be possible if they leave much property to others.
A life estate trust lets a couple pass the maximum amount of property to their children or other beneficiaries after both spouses die, while at the same time ensuring the surviving spouse is financially comfortable. It's one of the few times in life you really can have it both ways.
Instead of leaving property outright to the survivor, each spouse leaves most or all of his or her property to a ""marital life estate trust."" When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse can use that property, with certain restrictions, but doesn't own it outright. That's the reason behind the big tax savings: The property isn't subject to estate tax when the second spouse dies, because the second spouse never legally owned it.
When setting up a marital life estate trust, each spouse names final beneficiaries who will receive that trust's property when the surviving spouse dies. Spouses often name the same people--the couple's children--as final beneficiaries, but it's not mandatory.
Example: Christine and Thierry have a combined estate of $1,100,000, all shared ownership property. If each left his or her half, $550,000, to the surviving spouse outright, that spouse would be left with an estate of $1,100,000. If the surviving spouse died in 2002 with an estate worth $1,100,000, $400,000 would be subject to estate tax.
But if Christine and Thierry each leave their half of the trust property in a living trust with marital life estate, naming their five children as the trust's final beneficiaries, no estate taxes will be due. This is because when the first spouse dies, her $550,000 goes into the marital life estate trust, and is subject to estate tax at this time. But because the amount in the marital life estate trust is less than the federal estate tax threshold, no tax is due. Similarly, when the surviving spouse dies, his $550,000 is not subject to tax.
The surviving spouse has limited power over the assets in the life estate trust. The extent of this power depends on the terms of the trust, within certain limits set by the IRS. If a surviving spouse is given more power than IRS rules allow, the surviving spouse becomes the legal owner of the trust property--exactly what you don't want.
After the death of the surviving spouse, the marital life estate trust property is distributed to the final beneficiaries, chosen by the deceased spouse in the original trust document. The surviving spouse's property is also distributed to her beneficiaries.
Before creating a living trust with marital life estate, couples should understand what they're getting into. Once one spouse dies, a marital life estate trust cannot be changed.
Restrictions on the surviving spouse's use of the property. As discussed above, the surviving spouse has only limited rights to use trust property in the marital life estate trust.
Expense of legal or accounting help. When one spouse dies, the survivor may need to hire a lawyer or accountant to determine how to best divide the couple's assets between the irrevocable marital life estate trust and the surviving spouse's revocable living trust. How the property is divided can have important tax consequences.
Trust tax returns. The surviving spouse must get a taxpayer ID number for the marital life estate trust and file an annual trust income tax return. This isn't a big deal, but like any tax return, it requires some work.
Recordkeeping. The surviving spouse must keep separate records for the marital life estate trust property.
Commonly, younger couples create a basic shared living trust. When they're older--say in their later 50s or 60s--they revoke it and create a living trust with marital life estate. And if one spouse unexpectedly dies soon, the survivor will inherit everything estate-tax-free, no matter what the amount. The surviving spouse will probably have years to use the money--and to find other methods of reducing eventual estate tax.
Many couples in second or subsequent marriages. There may be concern about conflicts between the surviving spouse and the deceased spouse's children, who must essentially share ownership of property for many years. Despite its possible drawbacks, a living trust with marital life estate does work very well for many families. Many older couples conclude that the relatively minor accounting and recordkeeping hassles are outweighed by the benefits.
Why Worry About Estate Tax?
You can leave any amount of property, no matter how much it is worth, to your surviving spouse free of federal estate tax. So why concern yourself with avoiding estate tax, even if your combined estate is large enough to owe tax?
The problem comes if, as is common, you want to leave most, or all, of your property to your spouse. Suppose you have a combined estate worth $1 million. Each spouse's share is worth $500,000. When the first spouse dies, there are no federal estate taxes, no matter who the property is left to, because that spouse's $500,000 estate is under the tax threshold.
But if the deceased spouse leaves all his property to the surviving spouse, the survivor's estate is now worth the entire $1 million, over the federal taxable limit until the year 2006. When this spouse dies, stiff federal estate tax rates apply.
Estate planners call a tax due on the death of the surviving spouse the ""second tax."" A living trust with marital life estate can eliminate this second tax.

"Ever since the globalization from the internet, the search for Chinese brides has increased tenfold. There are already countless online expertise and firms that are experts in finding ideal Chinese brides. Most of these agencies may possibly charge you a large fee, although there are also various that offer the services for free. You merely need to know what you are looking for.
China brides participate in the western European ideals of fashion and are elegantly ethnic although still maintaining their own Japanese charm. Small , and slim, Chinese brides tend to have a doll-like facial physical appearance.  It is known that Chinese language brides have got very little makeup on their face. As a result, foreign men who like Oriental brides will need to dress a bit more officially than their Caucasian equivalent to “discover” the exotic beauty from the oriental lady.
When Oriental women migrate to the western world to marry and also the, some of them settle in the United States, Canada, or perhaps the United Kingdom. A large number of young Chinese language women wedded foreign guys end up keeping yourself permanently. The reason is , they truly feel more secure in their new residence countries in which they belong. For others, marriage to a international man would be the easiest way to escape the lower income and limited opportunities that life in China may possibly offer. A lot of Chinese women who work in world-wide organizations and travel to and fro between the east and west earn a larger salary than their alternative at home.
Although it is true that you have many advantages to getting married to a foreign person, there are also a number of disadvantages. As an example, Chinese girls tend to be more traditional than females from other civilizations. For this reason, chinese women happen to be unlikely to get interested in men with minimal education or perhaps money.

"Every year around this time the PaganCentric web site enjoys (or suffers from, depending upon your perspective) a temporary notoriety around Saint Patrick’s Day. I posted an article back in 2009 about my personal beliefs concerning the holiday, Saint Patrick and getting drunk in general, mostly because one of my early students asked me to explain what I believed. Since then, it’s amazed me how many arguments have been started over that post, and I’m still rather perplexed by the annual airing of grievances over this one article.
If you read the comments, one of the first things you’ll notice is that most of the people who take issue with the post do so specifically not because of what I actually said, but rather because of what they think I said. The one overall pattern I’ve noticed through the years is that a lot of people seem to like to take certain pieces out of context and then argue over them, often disconnected from the point I was trying to make. It’s frustrating, really. It’s like trying to discuss your personal views about the additives you’ll find in the hamburger meat at a fast food restaurant and having someone take you to task by defending farmers who grow beans for the fast-food chili. Most of the arguments people have made against some of the things I’ve said leave me scratching my head, really. How do you discuss any of these issues with people who start off expressing their opinions by dismissing everything you’ve said? Especially when they’re usually arguing not with the points you were trying to make, but instead with their own preconceptions and points, which they arrived with, already prepared to spar over?
I usually approve the comments. Even though it’s dispiriting that an article which was never intended as anything other than an expression of my personal faith and practice has become a focal point for nay-sayers and reactionary pseudo-historians, I do believe that discussion and debate is healthy. If anything saddens me, it’s that so many people argue over points which I never tried to make, getting passionate over things that they thought I was trying to say and missing my intentional points entirely.
For the record, when I use the word “Pagan”, it is not intended to reflect the contemporary use of the word. When I say I am a Pagan, it does not mean that I am a member of some uninterrupted tradition handed down from antiquity. We all know that there was no distinct Pagan religion that was suppressed by the Christian church, which survived by being hidden away in damp caves somewhere near the Cliffs of Dover. The word “Pagan” to me means simply “not Christian”. And while I do use the word to encapsulate my beliefs, which do owe a lot to modern Paganism, you might understand me better by realizing that in my tradition a Hindu is just as much of a Pagan as a Wiccan. Expand your definitions and you might understand me better. I am not talking about Little Miss Ravenwing Silverbritches when I talk about Pagans.
When I talk about my personal history and identify myself a hereditary witch, that does not mean I am saying that my personal beliefs and family history gives my opinions more weight or that my way is the only way. It’s simply my way of telling you that for me this is a personal thing. What I believe was handed down to me through family as my tradition. If your college teachers have told you certain things about Irish history, Saint Patrick and the suppression of native superstitions and religious thought, that’s all well and good. But I won’t debate with you over beliefs that were held by my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. Especially when what you wish to argue about is largely opinion.
Well, I’ve mostly frustrated myself in writing this. As if often the case when addressing detractors, somewhere along the line I found myself not really caring anymore. All I’ll say on the matter is that if you read that article, which I called, perhaps wrongly, “Pagans and Saint Patrick’s Day: The Real Meaning of the Holiday“, keep in mind that I was expressing my personal path and family tradition, and did not in any way intend for the article to be considered as an infallible historical document or definitive, all-encompassing manifesto about Pagan belief. It’s what I believe, right or wrong, and nothing more than that.
I want to thank those who have been supportive through the years. Some people actually “get” what I was trying to do with that article (which was mostly to talk about why I don’t celebrate Saint Patrick’s Day). For those who have taken certain things and ran with them, I respect your views and opinions, but don’t always have a clue what you’re talking about. None of this is written in stone. Any of the sources you cite to support your passionate arguments can be contradicted by any number of other materials that argue just the opposite. Honestly, I don’t care what you believe. Nothing you say can convince me that my ancestors were wrong about everything they taught me. That my beliefs and your beliefs don’t match up is simply a testament to the richness and diversity of the human experience. Our differences should be celebrated and embraced.
If you’re ever interested in engaging with me and talking calmly about these issues, you will find that I welcome it. But when you immediately weigh in by being confrontational and insulting, that tells me that you are not defending your personal beliefs, but are rather defending an established canon of views that someone else has taught you. If you learn nothing else from your visits to PaganCentric, I hope you will understand that our goal here is to reject all bias and start from scratch. I am not, in any way, shape or form, saying that my way, or the way of anyone else involved in PaganCentric, is the only way. All we are saying is that there are alternatives to every belief system. Even history is often revised to weed out previous biases (or to install new ones).
If you want to argue with us, argue with us on the points at hand, not about your preconceptions. And please accept that if your primary goal is to be heard, we will only engage with you if you state an arguable fact. If you state an opinion, that probably won’t be addressed.
Nothing I’ve written here has come out the way I intended. What I set out to write is not what I wound up with. Please accept my apologies if I’ve seemed confrontational. I don’t mean to be, but I’m all too aware that my ways of speaking and addressing points often come off as “brisk”. Honestly, I’m just writing something here because I felt that I needed to. But specifically in regard to Saint Patrick’s Day, I don’t feel that anything I’ve previously said needs to be revised, with the possible exception of some of the finer historical points regarding the life of Saint Patrick himself. All the rest is a matter of personal belief, and, as such, is not up for review (although it is certainly up for discussion).
In closing, I’d like to welcome everyone who stopped by the PaganCentric web site on Saint Patrick’s Day to engage with us. It was nice to see you. I wish you well as you leave this space and go on about your lives in the coming year, forgetting all about your brief visit with PaganCentric. We’ll see you again next year when the sparring begins anew, and we promise to meet you with arms wide open, hearts full of warmth and regard, and a smile upon our faces.
I’m sorry to hear what a burden that article has been. I must admit I did find this site today because of it, and for that I’m thankful.
I think I see how that was your perception of a popular holiday, but I must admit as a fairly newborn pagan, it shed light on some things that I didn’t know. Thanks for sharing that with us.
As for crazed responses… isn’t that what we all risk by posting on the internet?
Thanks for posting your article from ’09 and this follow up article.
By your definition of Pagan, I am one as well and I typically group all beliefs into that category that aren’t christian/muslim. So I get that.
Something I don’t get is the militancy that people bring when discussing these subjects. I have a Pagan friend that I arbitrarily wish happy st. pat’s day today and confirmed I said it in the most sercular way possible. And I got a gruff short lecture & the ‘you don’t know anything about my people’ vibe.
Your post above is not in any way confrontational in my opinion. You calmly expressed your belief & disbelief at the responses you got to the ’09 post.
Thank you for calmly putting out there what you feel, believe & hold to.
As someone surrounded by witches, pagans and christians, I sincerely appreciate your open, conversation style.
I’m sorry it’s been a pain in the rear. However, thank you for expressing yourself. It IS appreciated.
Strange. I actually came to this article after reading your write from ’09. I thought it was one of the better articles written on the subject. That you were explaining your faith was rather obvious to me. I didn’t get the feeling you were bashing St Patrick either, like so many articles on the subject tend to do. Sorry to hear so many narrow minds thought differently. From what I have read here and elsewhere, the story of St. Patrick is purely symbolic. Though, I am wondering if there are any source materials that talk about him actually chasing out the Druids etc or if it was more of a mythical narrative developed by the Church of the time and then on. I hope that I am being clear. I do understand that St. Patrick was responsible for the expansion of the Church in Ireland. What I am asking is about, how effective that was in driving out the pagans. Clearly, there was an influence and impact by the spreading of Christianity. I am curious about how much St. Patrick was actually responsible for and how much he was given credit for without actually doing. Not to absolve him, just an interest in history. From what I know only two letters of his still exist. Do you know any materials that may be helpful in these regards? Or even any stories you are familiar with from oral tradition.
I enjoyed the 2009 article. I’ve never felt there was much to celebrate on St. Patrick’s Day. I spent the day putting native plants in my front yard. There is more green for everyone, and other vibrant colors for the hummingbirds, finches, butterflies, moths, and bees. Yesterday helped to plant some ash trees in a park. Last year it was oak and sycamore.
I found you because of this article as well, and am very grateful for it. You put in words what I have been saying and trying to explain for years. I did share your article on my FB yesterday, and even though my friends are very respectful, I know I have stirred some of them up…YAY!
I believe what you are referring to when people find themselves in a fit of rage (or disbelief or whatever), it is called cognitive dissonance.
Cognitive dissonance happens when a person or group of people are accustomed to believing a certain way about a holiday, person, political party, school system, etc… (you get the point), and when they are given new information that is contrary to what is comfortable to their belief, they vehemently reject it, or they attempt to put that new information seamlessly into their old patterns of belief. This is never effective.
Our ethno/cultural (global) society today is experiencing several avenues of cognitive dissonance. It is tricky to navigate. It takes major shifts in the psyche to handle the amount of fast changes occuring today, when one grows up in a rigid, structured community.
Higher order thinking/critical thinking is challenging, and often it is easier to be “told” what to believe and how, than to question.
Anyway, thank you for posting. It is well received with me.
I read your article yesterday as it was doing the rounds on Facebook. I didn’t find the personal views in it strange (except the comment comparison of modern neopagans to jews in the wake of the holocaust which I though was insensitive and a little foolish, no direspect). In fact I could quite understand them if you believe half the things stated in your article are true.
One of the things that I didn’t like about the article was the lack of historical sources or evidence you make for your claims. You made some pretty heavy claims with no evidence. I think this is why many people where offended by it. As some of it came across, as what it was: a very romantic account of Irish culture and history written by an American who knows very little about Ireland and her people.
I also felt the article was unnecessarily and unfairly anti-christian, inflammatory in many ways, at some points bordering on hate speech. Yes you claimed that you don’t begrudge people celebrating St Patricks day yet in the same breath you make a lot of unfounded accusations about historical Christians in Ireland.",http://pagancentric.org/the-annual-st-patricks-day-rumble/

"Our club has always taken a fairly structured approach to investing. We were very keen to establish some sort of strategy early in the life of our club and this is why our first meeting after the inauguration of the club was a Strategy Planning meeting. As our Club evolved and our experience and confidence increased, we revised the strategy and formalised it in 2001 when we produced our Investment Strategy document. Our Club has been very successful in terms of the returns we have had from our investments and we are proud of this success. We strongly believe that a considerable factor in our success has been the thought that has gone into our strategy and the discipline of following it. The Strategy sets out the concept of a ""3 sub-portfolio"" approach with each having its own, well defined characteristics.
Please read our strategy and please let us know what you think. A quick summary is provided below.
Companies that we believe will produce a steady return over a number of years. Detailed analysis of a company's fundamentals are required and a buy proposal document must be produced before the club will consider a purchase. In practice, this portfolio has frequently been underweight as (a) it requires a fair bit of effort to perform the necessary analysis and (b) it has been difficult to find companies that we are all happy to agree on!
This sub-portfolio provides a means by which we can make higher risk investments, invest in markets or instruments that we wouldn't otherwise consider, etc. Less analysis is required than for the Fundamental sub-portfolio. A buy proposal document must still be produced but a cut-down version is used reflecting the less detailed level of analysis required.
Shares are bought and sold on a regular basis using clearly defined criteria. To provide diversification, shares are selected on alternative months using 'value' and 'growth' criteria. Further details can be found in the mechanical investing section.
A more detailed presentation on our club's strategy and how it works was given to the Mobius Investment Club in December 2004 and can be found here. The theme of this presentation has been revisited for presentations to the annual National Investment Club Conferences that started in 2007.
We formally review the strategy each summer. In order to assist the review, the performance of each of the three sub-strategies is analysed and we determine whether it they have met their stated objectives.",http://rollingstocks.co.uk/strategy.html
"Over the past several years, scholars around the world have begun to adopt an expansive view of the medieval world as an interconnected and culturally diverse landscape. While notions of the “Global Middle Ages”[1] will continue to be debated, the concept has provoked critical conversations about the ways in which the migration of people, the exchange of ideas, the circulation of commodities, and the spread of disease shaped the medieval world. Whether the motivation was exploration, piety, diplomacy, knowledge, or profit, the movement of people was a fundamental characteristic of the late medieval Mediterranean world (ca. 1250-1500). While these networks certainly formed the basis for establishing transregional connections, itinerant scholars, merchants, soldiers, and pilgrims were not the only travelers in the medieval world.
The Catalan Atlas, ca. 1375, produced by Abraham and Jehudà Cresques in late 14th-century Majorca, provides a vision of a highly-connected medieval world characterized by ethnic, cultural and political diversity woven together through a web of trade routes and mercantile networks. The full manuscript has been digitized by the Bibliothèque nationale de France.
Migration could also be involuntary (exile, expulsion and enslavement), prompted by violent repression, or driven by economic necessity. The last few years has seen increased attention to the histories of religious refugees, economic migrants and political exiles in the medieval and early modern world. One important recent contribution, Migrants in Medieval England, c. 500-c. 1500, for example, draws on interdisciplinary research in genetics, linguistics, archaeology, art and literature to illustrate the social and cultural effects of migration on medieval English society.[2] Investigating the phenomenon of migration induced by religious persecution and expulsion, Nicholas Terpstra’s Religious Refugees in the Early Modern World has demonstrated how the forced migration of millions of Jews, Muslims, and Christians across Europe and around the globe shaped the early modern world and profoundly affected literature, art, and culture.[3] Another recent book, Migration Histories of the Medieval Afroeurasian Transition Zone,[4] covers migration histories of the regions between the Mediterranean and Central Asia and between Eastern Europe and the Indian Ocean in the centuries from Late Antiquity up to the early modern era. It includes essays by experts in Byzantine, Islamic, Medieval and African history that provide detailed analyses of specific regions and groups of migrants, both elites and non-elites as well as voluntary and involuntary to enrich our understanding of migration as a complex transhistorical phenomenon that has shaped (and continues to shape) human societies.

These short textual fragments appear to suggest that on two separate occasions, in February 1463 and June 1463, small numbers of Muslim inhabitants of Misrata, near Tripoli (modern-day Libya), along with their families, voluntarily migrated to Malta to live as farmers under Latin Christian rule. It demonstrates the tremendous agency of these individuals, who sought to escape injustice and hardship by undertaking the (highly) perilous journey to Malta, an island inhabited almost entirely by Christians and which was part of the extensive domains of the Crown of Aragón. The fact that these migrants were welcomed and granted land in Malta is all the more interesting in light of the broader geo-political context and cultural context of the mid-15th century Mediterranean world, which witnessed heightened anxieties, religious tensions and millenarian sentiments following the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (May 1453) and the imperial expansion that characterized the reign of Mehmed II (r. 1452-1481).

It reflects the importance of local arrangements, and individual relationships in structuring the politics of the Mediterranean world. While religious hostility, confessional tensions and violence were undoubtedly an important reality that shaped attitudes and policies during this period, this did not preclude collaboration and negotiation across religious and cultural boundaries. There may have even been a demographic and agricultural demand for the types of skills and labor provided by the migrants. Throughout the 15th century, Malta’s population remained relatively small, and was constantly depleted as a result of emigration and enslavement. This meant that there was a surplus of land and a dearth of labor, which posed major problems for an economy that was primarily agricultural. An important testimony of the importance of Malta’s agriculture is provided by the traveler Anselm Adorno, who visited Malta in 1470 and noted that the economy was based largely upon the growth of cotton and cumin.[7] This demand for labor, particularly in the cultivation of cotton, might explain the willingness of the local authorities in Malta to welcome the migrants and grant them land.

Significantly, while underscoring the perceived transgression of social and religious boundaries in the migration of these individuals from Islamic lands to Latin Christendom, ‘Abd al-Bāsiṭ does not seek to represent the migrants themselves as particularly nefarious. Rather, the emphasis on the fact that they were compelled by necessity and desperation to “flee” and “seek refuge” from the injustice of the Hafsid governor of Tripoli reflects a particular concern with social injustice and political repression as a cause of migration. ‘Abd al-Bāsiṭ describes the governor of Tripoli, whose name was Abū Naṣr [b.  He also states that “I have been informed that each year he sends over 100,000 gold dinars…which he extracts through an oppressive regime of taxation that imposes hardships on the people.”[9] This explicitly connected Abū Naṣr’s oppressive conduct with his burdensome fiscal policies. Significantly, the emphasis in his passage about the migrants to Malta was not that they would be paying considerably less taxes, since it is stated that they would pay the amount that “they had been accustomed to paying to the governor of Tripoli.” Rather, ‘Abd al-Bāsiṭ suggests that they would “be protected from injustice and secure in their lives and property.” As such, the inclusion of this anecdote was an attempt to make a broader claim about the nature of justice and its importance for establishing a stable society. ‘Abd al-Bāsiṭ considered the migration of the inhabitants of Misrata to be a lamentable and deplorable state of affairs, which reflected poorly upon both Abū Naṣr as well as the Hafsid sovereign Abū ‘Amr Uthmān, who he represents as showing little interest in the well-being of his own subjects. Migration, then, could be seen as constituting part of a larger polemic that sought to cast aspersions upon the legitimacy of Hafsid rule. The idea that the inhabitants of Misrata preferred to reside under Latin Christian rule than under Islamic political authority would have been an effective way to emphasize this point.

So, one might ask, why Malta? What factors shaped the decision of these migrants to sail to this Christian island? It is particularly significant that they chose to migrate to Malta in particular. It demonstrates the importance of linguistic affinities, as well as the practical considerations of migration. Their decision to journey to Malta was probably motivated by the fact that the Maltese vernacular was essentially a dialect of Arabic which was intelligible to the inhabitants of Misrata. This fact is attested by many of the surviving documents and literary sources from this period.[10] One of the most important of these is the Il-Kantilena, the oldest known literary text in the Maltese language, authored by the Maltese poet and philosopher Pietru Caxaro (d. 1485) during the late 15th century.[11] Il-Kantilena is notable for its extensive Arabic vocabulary, demonstrating its relationship and proximity to the Siculo-Arabic spoken in Sicily during the 11th-13th centuries. The close association between Malta and the Arabic language of its inhabitants was frequently invoked as a fundamental characteristic of the island well into the early modern period. The Morisco notable Francisco Núñez Muley (d. after 1567), for example, writing in Granada (Spain), proclaimed that “those who live on the not-so-distant island of Malta are Catholic Christians and nobles who speak Arabic and use Arabic to write texts having to do with the Holy Catholic faith and other Christian matters. I also believe that they say mass in Arabic.”[12] Despite the religious differences between the Maltese Christians and the Muslim inhabitants of Misrata, the Arabic language and shared history would have served as a common source of affinity. This did not preclude the existence of serious tensions, of course, but it would have certainly enabled the migrants to communicate with their new hosts and negotiate the terms of their arrival and settlement.
Pietru Caxaro, Il-Kantilena, 15th century, the oldest known literary text in the Maltese language.
There was also another, more practical reason why these migrants would have sailed to Malta. The island was located nearby, approximately 400 km north of Misrata, directly off a major sailing route (as indicated by the many portolan charts from the 15th century). Malta would also have been quite familiar to the inhabitants of Misrata as a result of the various connections, including both trading and raiding, which had existed for centuries. In addition to being under Islamic rule from 870 to 1091, there is evidence to indicate that there were still numerous Muslim families living on the royal estates of the islands of Malta and Gozo as late as the mid-13th century.[13] Several decades before the migrants from Misrata made their journey, the Hafsid royal fleet had besieged Malta in September 1429, devastating the island and enslaving a large part of the island’s population.[14] It is plausible that many of these enslaved peoples would have been known to the inhabitants of Misrata, and some of them may have even been among the migrants themselves.Commercial activity and intermittent warfare would have intimately bound the two regions together, and fostered a certain familiarity between the inhabitants of the Muslim-Christian borderlands in the central Mediterranean.
It is also plausible that these individuals from Misrata were following a common route of migration, and were hardly the first to make the journey. The phenomenon of migration from North Africa to Malta during the late 14th and early 15th century may also be attested by onomastics. As Godfrey Wettinger has shown, the name “Muhammed” and its various forms (muhumudi, muhamud, muhumud) appears as a surname for several individuals in a 1419 militia roll from Malta, but is unattested as a surname in the rosters of 1480.[15] Without further research and evidence, it is difficult to speculate, but the questions remain: did this name belong to migrants from North Africa? What explains its disappearance by 1480? Does this reflect the processes of conversion and assimilation as part of the integration of these individuals into Maltese Christian society?

While it is plausible that ‘Abd al-Bāsiṭ’s account about the migration from Misrata to Malta in the 15th century was a didactic story that sought to caution readers against political injustice and fiscal oppression, this post has attempted to encourage further inquiry into the question of economic migration in the medieval Mediterranean world. While much more research into the extensive and well-preserved Maltese archives will certainly bring much more evidence about the relationship between medieval Malta and North Africa to light, this particular episode underscores the importance of economic and political circumstances, individual agency and religious boundaries in shaping the history of migration in the late medieval Mediterranean world. Although distinctly medieval in a number of ways, it raises important questions about the role of migration, voluntary or otherwise, in shaping human societies over the centuries.

If you ever fall asleep and wake up in a strange fantasy world, there is no reason to panic. Even if you have never rolled a d20 or published an article on Tolkien, you probably know you will be meeting your traveling party at an inn, dealing with a dragon or two, and feasting like it’s 1480 and you plan to commission a 124-folio illuminated manuscript account of your wedding that will also be printed for distribution to a wide public readership. [1] You know these things because a facsimile of the Middle Ages has been host to wizards, jinn, and paladins since Lord of Rings, since Gothic fiction, since 1000 Nights became 1001. And now you can know that medieval history holds all the answers you need to survive and triumph in a five-volume fantasy trilogy.
At least, this is the premise of my new book, How to Slay a Dragon: A Fantasy Hero’s Guide to the Real Middle Ages (Tiller Press, 2001). It is a handbook for heroes that uses fantasy tropes as allegory to teach medieval history–and a little bit about critical interpretation of sources along the way. Throughout the book, you take on the role of an illiterate peasant (a Chosen One?) called to a quest (slaying a dragon, saving the princess, figuring out what to do while the princess saves herself), and every chapter presents a common trope–the more magical, the better–as a problem to solve.
Befriending the Enchanted Forest might not be possible because enchanted forests do not exist, but Muslim and Christian rulers alike showed off their power and riches with silver forests filled with golden chirping automatons. Medieval patterns of evangelization and conversion demonstrate the exact opposite of Bringing the Old Gods Back, but the Sphinx guarded the desert outside the Fatimid capital, and Abu Ja’far al-Idrisi (d. 1251) wanted to know why. (Caliphs were more interested in staging races up the Great Pyramid and throwing torchlit parties at Giza.) If you have ever needed to survive some shrieking eels or use linguistic evidence to reconstruct Early English beacon warning systems, How to Slay a Dragon is the book for you.
From the standpoint of writing the book, on the other hand, one of the big advantages of working with an editor and sales team at a major publishing house was to see what did and did not appeal to them along the way. The ideas seem basic, especially from a classroom point of view, but the publishers’ explicit acknowledgment of them suggests both their necessity and a feeling that they are lacking in the overall public discourse on the Middle Ages.
It was vital to me to write about a “medieval world,” not just the western Europe that underlies traditional fantasy (or as I like to put it, A Fantasy Hero’s Guide to Fifteenth-Century Germany and Tenth-Century Cairo). What “medieval world” does and should mean in scholarship is constantly in flux, but I ultimately settled on a spiderweb approach: the economic and cultural networks that criss-crossed the world around the Mediterranean, with branches stretching out to the Sámi, Mali, Sumatra. My editor was thrilled that this approach acted as a counterpoint to narratives of the mythic white Middle Ages, and suggested that the push to diversify the fantasy genre has made average readers hungrier for a historical accuracy hunt in the medieval Islamic world as well.
Although most of the 1000-1500 word chapters bring together information from three to eight secondary sources and the occasional primary, several chapters zoom in on one or two primary sources, for example, John of Morigny’s Liber florum (“How to train a wizard”) and Bertrandon de la Brocquière’s Le Voyage de Outre-Mer (“How to cross the barren wastes”). [2] My editor thought readers would respond really well to my method of talking the reader through the source bit by bit, gradually revealing its own genre elements and how we should not take primary sources at face value.
Because How to Slay a Dragon is essentially Medieval Studies 101 using a fantasy epic instead of a timeline as its narrative, I tried to be very specific about the time and place of every anecdote, event, or text. I was surprised at how strongly my editor stressed this point as well. But even more, she insisted that I include background information about primary sources. Once again, I think it’s a good lesson that people are hungry for firsthand access to actual medieval writing and material objects, but also to know how to understand them.
Throughout the process, the strength of the book’s quest through-narrative was the biggest point of contention between my editor and me. My original vision was to use the tropes as an excuse to talk about the “cool parts” of medieval history (need to cross a cursed swamp? Let me tell you about bathhouse ghosts and London’s public toilets). But the marketing team in particular pointed to the self-insert, immersive aspect of fantasy gaming (computer and tabletop) and even fanfiction, not just reading, in terms of how people engage medievalist fantasy. After all, as Tolkien himself pointed out in “On Fairy-Stories,” part of the eternal appeal of fantasy is the escape into another world–your escape.
Although the first three points are foundational to how I, a medieval historian, approach the Middle Ages, I find it significant that my editor and marketing team believe so strongly in their place in books aimed at a popular audience. And if you are interested, of course, I invite you to see an example of how they can play out in How to Slay a Dragon: A Fantasy Hero’s Guide to the Real Middle Ages.

"When my high school teacher told us that each page of the book he read last night shackled him, at least I did not believe him till I picked up ‘What it’s like to me’ during my stay at London. Each page would bind me with its sheer beauty of expression and power of words. This gem of a book is written and illustrated by disabled children across the world.
The book reveals many facets of the life led by disabled children and one experiences what it is like to be a disabled child. You share their sadness, not for being disabled but for your negative attitude, their positive approach towards life and also their uncommon wit and assertion for their rights.
In the first few chapters itself, they make it very clear that they know what they are and don’t like pity and unnecessary stares.
Why do people take us for unhappy children?
for we are as happy as any other.
Children very vividly show their understanding through suffering.
I have been born with cerebral palsy, so really I do not know what it’s like to run and play like normal kids. But I am glad that I am alive, so I can show other people how lucky they are to be able to walk. And I truly believe that God made me this way because He knows I could live with disability.
Then you are stuck by their wit, ability to laugh at themselves.
Children are also aware of their rights and assert themselves.
What I need from you is only my rights and not a lot of sympathy.
Though they are children, they cannot be taken for a ride.
It’s not the handicapped people who need rehabilitation, but the rest of the world. Don’t pat on the head, offer help, talk to handicapped people out of pity. Talk to them because you like them. Otherwise, don’t bother.
Helen writes in the introduction that when she asked children to write about ‘What it’s like to me’ many of the children told her how they had spent the day or how they enjoyed music or sport. The last thing they were concerned about was the fact that they might have taken an hour or more to get dressed. The sort of thing – a straight forward physical disability – is just part of life. They accept it and want you to do the same.
Helen Exley, editor of this colourful and poignant book, found it “the most genuinely happy book I have ever edited”. She had several disabled friends in childhood, (later trained as a “speech and deaf therapist”) and edited the book while she had a serious illness and faced her own fears. The children and staff of over 100 schools and organizations from 27 countries contributed to this book.
The book is a gem. A must for one and all for the sheer sweet sour pleasure it provides.
The children that have contributed to and essentially created this book speak from the heart. Not only have they learned to deal with their disability enough to be themselves and be honest with people. The overall attitude of the children’s’ writing is not always positive and at times speaks to the reader from a somewhat angry viewpoint. Even when angry, these children are never accusing or pleading for the help and pity of others. Instead, these children speak to us in a voice that attempts to communicate their hopes, dreams, aspirations and above a level of understanding on the part of ‘ordinary people’. Topics in this book deal with everything from deafness and blindness to dealing with feelings of scorn and isolation. These children also share some of their personal triumphs in an attempt to make others realize that they would rather be respected and accepted as human beings than pitied as disabled individuals.
“What It’s Like To Be Me” contains the comments of disabled children on what it’s like to be in a wheelchair or otherwise disabled. It was prepared during the International Year of the Disabled as a contribution by handicapped children. The book was designed so that these children could communicate with other children and with their parents and teachers.
Because I also am in a wheelchair, I can identify with the kids’ comments. Mostly they have the same attitudes that I have. They say that when they go to shopping centres people look at them as though they are from another planet. I think that’s true.
I can also identify with the remark of one contributor, who said “I can answer for myself”, because people tend to assume you can’t speak for yourself if you are in a wheelchair. I think if people read this book it will make them realize that we aren’t as different as they think we are.
The drawings in the book aren’t that great, but the written comments are very accurate.
Doctors will benefit from reading this book because it will give them an idea of how disabled children feel about themselves. I also think that the book should be introduced to grade 2 and 3 students so that they will understand disabled children better.

"His celebrations were typically Australian, he wore his heart on his sleeve and just as in the race, he left nothing behind. Speaking on ABC radio overnight, Will Hagon described Webber’s release of emotion as being the culmination of not one race, or one result, but his entire motorsport career.
As a young boy starting his racing career at the Fairbairn Park karting track in Canberra, Webber would have been dreaming of this day. Now he has reached the summit. Mark Webber, from the small New South Wales city of Queanbeyan, is a Grand Prix winner!
Even better than that, his Red Bull Racing team are providing he and Sebastian Vettel with a potential championship winning car. They have clearly been the form team of the last few races and last night’s results saw both Vettel and Webber close the gap to championship leader Jenson Button.
Button heads the championship table with 68 points, Vettel is second on 47 points. Webber’s win sees him leap frog Rubens Barichello into third place in the driver’s championship on 45.5 points, with the Brazilian in fourth on 44 points. Felipe Massa is fifth in the driver standings, back on just 22 points.
After Brawn GP’s early season jump start on the competition, Red Bull Racing are also narrowing the gap in the constructor’s title which now stands, Brawn GP 112 points, Red Bull Racing 92.5 points and Toyota, third, on 34.5 points.
Mark Webber is just the third Australian driver to win a Formula One race, following in the footsteps of Alan Jones and Sir Jack Brabham. Amazingly, Webber’s maiden victory came in his 130th race start—Alan Jones had 116 race starts in his entire career, Brabham had 126. Let’s hope Webber can continue the legacy of Australians who have won a Grand Prix race have also gone on to win a World Championship.
Full driver quotes from the post-race press conference are available from Formula1.com. Red Bull Racing’s media release, along with a vast gallery of images from the race are available after the jump.
WEBBER’S FIRST WIN!
I haven’t stopped smiling since 11.40pm last night.
Ah far out! I’m OS at the moment and completely forgot about the GP, and Webber goes and gets his first win!
Well done, I hope he can stay up there for the rest of the season.

Alibaba was founded on 4th April, 1999, by a perennial failure named Jack Ma and his 17 close friends, who scraped together just US$80,000 from 80 small investors to start what was possibly a Third Revolution for China. Alibaba was China’s first online marketplace for Chinese companies. Today, the Revenue from Alibaba has topped US$56 Billion, with a Net Income of US$12 Billion. Jack Ma himself became the richest man in China, with a personal worth that exceeds US$47 Billion on Nov. 19, 2019. All this acquired in a span of just Twenty Years or less. And this is what makes the story of the History And Growth Of Alibaba so fascinating to follow.
In a sense, the story of Alibaba is the story of Jack Ma. It is the story of a man who never gave up, whose herculean efforts are now legendary. Even during the beginning of his childhood days, he had failed in his exams for Primary School, twice. During his Middle School exams, he failed three times. Entrance Exams to Universities were failed thrice. He wrote and applied Ten times to Harvard University, only to be rejected every time. Finally, he joined Hangzhou Normal University and did his Bachelor’s degree in English. Then came a protracted period, when he desperately tried to land a decent job, failing each time. Typically, KFC rejected his application, after accepting 23 other candidates. Even the Police Force refused him 5 times. But Jack could not be stopped. Even failing in two of his early Entrepreneurial Enterprises failed to damp the Spirit of Jack Ma. Overcoming his obstacles was second nature to him by now, and in 1995 he finally visited the US, for a Govt Project on Highway Building. In the US, he first came in contact with the Internet. He realized that while China’s economy was burgeoning on all aspects, the Internet Market was being sadly neglected. Ever the Dreamer, Jack Ma decided to change the scales of balance in his own country’s favor.
Alibaba began life as an eCommerce startup after Jack managed to convince 17 of his friends to join him in 1999. Trust was the key. Jack managed to build trust in the Chinese people on an Online System that promised Online Delivery of Packages and Payment, purely based on trust. Investment was still low, but at the age of 31, Jack Ma was on his way. All this was without knowing anything about computers or the Online, or ever selling any goods or services. Without a cent in external investments, only the US$80,000 they had scraped together initially from around 80 small investors, operating just from Jack’s Hangzhou apartment as an office, Alibaba took off like a space rocket to the skies. SoftBank invested US$20 Million. Then another investment of US$5 Million was made by Goldman Sachs. Alibaba now had more or less captured the Chinese Market, having seen off biggies like Amazon already. The never failing courage and optimism of Jack Ma’s personage rubbed off on the now vast organization, as well as the courtesy of all members of this fraternal company. Alibaba was now ready to look outside China for more business.
Alibaba now expanded across the globe, rapidly shedding the China shell, and venturing on to center-stage in the USA itself. With total assets of US$144 Billion, Alibaba has been welcomed with open arms by Wall Street, and regularly feature in Sensex, Nikkei, Dow Jones and all major Share markers, along with Sensei. As far as online traffic their ecommerce assets rival even the largest source of online traffic which of course is adult sites (click here). The fact that adult dating sites and other adult content is rivaled by high converting ecommerce destinations is astounding.

"Implementing counter-balancing in OpenSesame is quite straightforward once you know about a few system variables and how to use them in an experiment. This video runs through two types of counter-balancing: A simple counter-balancing system in which we have two blocks that we want to counter-balance across participants. The second, more complex, example, looks at how we can implement counter-balancing of three or more blocks using a reduced Latin square design.

"(Bel Air, Md., April 6, 2011) – As the 2011 celebration of Earth Day approaches on April 22, Harford Community College announces that it has captured and recycled 854,000 gallons of rainwater since 2006 as a result of three new rain collection systems that have been installed on campus.
Over the past 30 years, the overall amount of water usage on Harford Community College’s campus has remained steady despite the campus expanding its physical presence during that time by 170,000 gross square feet.
According to reports maintained by Harford Community College and reported to the Maryland Department of the Environment, Harford Community College withdrew 4.2 million gallons of water in 1979. The gross square footage of the campus at that time was 300,000, and the average water use was 14 gallons per square foot.
Fast forward more than 30 years to 2010. In that year, Harford Community College withdrew 4.2 million gallons of water. The gross square footage of the campus is now 470,000, and the average water usage is 8.9 gallons per square foot.
It is estimated by college officials that more than two million gallons of water have been saved each year since 1979 due to its water efficiency practices.
The installation of three rainwater collection areas over the past five years has helped to decrease the amount of water the campus would typically withdraw for use.
In 2006 one 20,000 gallon rain collection tank was installed in Joppa Hall. The following year, 2007, three 2,000 gallon water collection tanks were installed in Havre de Grace Hall. In 2010 four 1,000 gallon tanks were installed in the main lobby of Aberdeen Hall.
The collected rainwater is used in numerous ways, from flushing restroom fixtures in Havre de Grace Hall to watering plants in the Aberdeen Hall greenhouse to providing water for Joppa Hall’s energy-efficient evaporative cooling tower which serves a 78,000 square foot building.
More information about Harford Community College’s water efficiency efforts may be found at www.harford.edu/GreenHCC.
Harford Community College is a dynamic, open-access institution that promotes lifelong learning, workforce development and social and cultural enrichment serving more than 22,000 students. For more information, visit www.harford.edu.

"This particular program is unique for APS in that APS deploys its Boeing type-specific UPRT instructor to the customers preferred training location globally. Loss of Control In-flight (LOC-I) is defined as flight that occurs outside of the normal flight envelope with an inability of the pilot to control the aircraft. In a July 2016 report issued by Boeing for the years 2006 through 2015, LOC-I is identified as the leading cause of fatalities in commercial aviation worldwide. LOC-I represents more than 40% of all fatalities. The APS Boeing Type-Specific UPRT program, for both airlines and training centers, mitigates the LOC-I threat to air safety through pilot education and practical skill development. Capt. Dave Carbaugh , the former Boeing Chief Pilot Flight Operations Safety and primary author of the aviation industrys vetted and adopted Airplane Upset Recovery Training Aid, is both an APS-Certified Boeing Simulator UPRT Instructor and APS-Certified Boeing Simulator Train-the-Trainer Instructor. Carbaugh, the APS Boeing UPRT Chief Instructor, brings more than 40 years of all-attitude experience and years of training hundreds of Boeing airline pilots in full compliance with Boeing UPRT delivery guidance adhering to unfailing, precise compliance with APS UPRT technologies, advancements and proprietary training methods. This new Boeing Type-specific upset training program has been in development for over a decade and is completely ready for mainstream airline training delivery, says Paul BJ Ransbury, president of Aviation Performance Solutions.

"Flanders and Swann used to sing an amusing song about the Wompom – an imaginary animal / vegetable hybrid with an amazing range of properties. This song, which is still available on iTunes, often comes to mind when I’m reading about the latest “wonder material”: Graphene.
Graphene is harder than diamond and three hundred times stronger than steel, yet it is incredibly flexible and the world’s best conductor of electricity.
You can mould with a finger and thumb.
There is such an extraordinary range of potential uses for grapheme that there isn’t space to list them all here. However, to avoid diverging too far from the theme of this blog, some uses that may have an impact on telecoms include much faster integrated circuits, spray-on solar panels, massively increased battery capacities and lower cost displays that are simpler to recycle.
And that proves very useful indeed.
With a Wompom you have everything you need.

"My Baby bites!
I have an 11 month old little boy, who is normally a very easy going and overall good baby.
Lately, he has taken to biting me when he is frustrated, tired or just not liking it when he is not getting his own way. What do I do???? He seems to young to really understand the word ' no' as he just keeps doing it.
i know exactly how you feel my daughter (11 months on friday) is the same she has been biting mostly me for over a month now and it seems to be when she is tired, hungry or frustrated when she does it.
and i have tried saying ""no"" sternly to her but most of the time she thinks it is funny and laughs like she thinks we are playin a game.
hopefully someone has some suggestions because i would love to know what else to try.
the weird thing is she only seems to bite me not hubby and has only bitten a few other people maybe 2 times.
My son is 1 next week and has been doing this for a while, I just tell him no, a tap on the hand, and I walk away from him and ignore his biting..
Finally after about a month he has stopped, when he looks like he is going to do it I just say 'no biting' and walk away..
I honestly think it is a stage that eventually they will grow out of.
hi. u could try by giving him a warning and if he does it again u can either put him in a room with no toys or anywhere that u or him cant see one another, say in a corner. he stays there for 1 minute and after that u tell him what he has done wrong and ask him to giveu a kiss and hug. if he doesnt he stays for another minute. hope this helps.",http://assets-0.huggies-cdn.net/forum/5-toddler/50-feeding-your-toddler/390658-my-baby-bites

Bitty’s watching the Falconers game at the Haus when Jack gets checked hard. He skates off the ice but Bitty doesn’t even see it; he’s already out the door. His heart feels like it’s going to pound out of his chest all the way to Providence. When Jack gets home much later, after the game ends, Bitty’s paced himself into a worried mess. Cuddles ensue.
talk to me about little-spoon-jack-zimmermann eh?
If you haven’t read Check, Please!…what the heck are you waiting for?? I’m obsessed, in the best way!!

This is Jack’s favorite well-worn fantasy: he’s well regarded and plays well for a team he’s proud to be on, has a dog and a pond in his backyard that freezes over in the winter into a makeshift rink, and he’s happy in this warm, private life where the world lets him be.
It’s only recently that the dream has shifted. Nothing much changes, but the house smells like cinnamon instead of pine and books, and there are two dogs now and most notably: he’s not alone.
Jack never planned to come out to his parents. Never once thought that saying, “Mom, Dad, I’m bi,” was a conversation he would ever need to have.
Parse had been one thing but two times makes a pattern, and Jack thinks: maybe.
George is already onto him, and when Jack jumps over a snow bank to ask Bittle if he wants to get coffee, he’s hit with how transparent he is.
Jack returns with Bitty’s disgusting mocha concoction that the barista already knows, and his own London fog. They sit around the small round table, and Jack’s legs barely fit under it.
Bittle looks like he was created specifically to sit in coffee shops. 
“Oh, hi Jack,” she says.
She pauses, and the silence feels like it’s eating Jack from the inside out.
And then two minutes later Shitty is tackling Jack to his bed and kissing Jack’s face.
Jack, at the end of it all, just wants to be happy.
He’s struggled for a long time, and he’s worried about graduating. He’s worried about moving. He’s worried about where Shitty will go to law school. He’s worried about meeting new teammates, about losing old ones. He’s worried about Bittle.
One person can only do so many things, he understands. But he does want to have the comfort that he’s achieved at Samwell follow him into his life after graduation.
He thinks about how much his life has changed in the last year, how much better his hockey has been, how little his hands shake.
He knows that being friends with Bittle plays a big part of it. His confidence in his game and his personal life is better than it has ever been, and Bittle absolutely has inspired Jack to be better in that regard.
Jack thinks about how strong his game was when he played with Parson. 
And he knows that what he wants probably doesn’t exist; this imagined happiness that exists in his mind is immense; it’s probably heavy and there’s no way it’s cheap; it probably isn’t real.
Jack is sitting at the kitchen table while Bittle makes dinner. Jack doesn’t know where Holster went, Ransom has been locked in the attic for hours, and Shitty and Lardo went for Italian, so the Haus is quiet.
Jack rolls over to lay on his back, and waits until Bittle catches his breath. Jack works on keeping his head clear, on feeling the way Bittle’s thigh feels against his, the way his elbow feels pressed into Bittle’s bicep, the way Bittle is breathing evenly next to him.
Jack wants to remember this, this warm safety that exists in this shitty room in this shitty Haus.
Bittle’s fingers softly trace the inside of Jack’s forearm, and Jack rolls onto his side to face him.
“You okay?” Bittle asks.
Jack smiles and catches Bitty’s lips between his. “I’m good,” he says, and he finds that he really, really means it.
They fall asleep, and by the time Jack wakes up, he can hear music downstairs and the sound of people talking over each other, laughing.
Jack catches Bitty looking at his butt when he pull on his jeans, and they end up kissing against the door, fully dressed.
Bittle smiles at him fondly, and takes a deep breath. “Gosh,” he says, and Jack is so fond of him that he smiles back.
Bittle leans up and kisses Jack softly. “I’d like that,” he says. “I promise.” He mimes locking his lips shut and throwing away the key, and Jack smiles.
When Jack ushers Bitty down the stairs, Shitty spots them, smirks at Jack, and Jack feels his face flush.
And suddenly Shitty is standing on the coffee table and the frogs are there, and Ransom and Holster, and Shitty shouts, “Oh captain, my captain,” and everyone raises their drinks at Jack, and Jack thinks: okay.
Once the party dies down, Jack sneaks into Bittle’s room.
Bitty is beer-sleepy and curled on his side, and when Jack crawls in behind him, he hums happily. He drunkenly reaches behind him to find Jack’s hand, and pulls Jack’s arm around his middle.
Bittle falls back to sleep immediately, and Jack pulls the comforter over them.
Jack has made any number of mistakes in his life, but if all of them led to this little moment—his nose tucked into the nape of Eric Bittle’s neck and his heart full in a way he hasn’t ever felt—he can’t bring himself to regret any of them.
Jack sits behind Bittle’s parents with the rest of the team who is still around new England, and when Bittle walks across the stage, they all holler.
Bitty takes the fancy piece of paper and exits stage left, and then Jack realizes that they still have another 24 letters in the alphabet to get through, and he thinks: Tabarnac.
By the end of the ceremony, his neck is stiff. When it’s over, Bitty’s mother hugs him, says she’s very proud of him, that they watch his games at home whenever they’re able. He flushes, and thanks her. He says, “Congratulations on Eric’s graduation. You must be very proud,” and she hugs him again, her eyes big and wet.
When Bittle comes into the ground and finds his parents, he hugs them both, and clings to his mother in a way that tugs at Jack’s heartstrings.
And then Shitty is rushing over, and he yells, “Bits, my man!” and Bittle turns to hug Shitty just as tightly.
Jack catches Bitty’s eye over Shitty’s shoulder, and Bittle smiles. He mouths Hi silently and as Shitty releases him, he pats Shitty’s shoulder. Jack sticks his hand out to shake Bitty’s hand, and Bitty rolls his eyes.
“Oh my God, Jack,” he hears Shitty say, and Bitty bats his hand away and hugs him.
“Thanks for coming,” Bitty says into Jack’s chest.
“I wouldn’t miss it for the world,” he says, and he finds that it’s true.
“I haven’t even asked you anything,” Jack says, confused.
thank you to defcontwo for the beta and to ruba for the constant encouragement and friendship.
i also made a playlist for these boys, which can be found here.
John, you find the coolest stuff!
Aww! Gosh, thanks Chuck! Can you believe it, I discovered Ngozi's cartoon when I was looking at London Spy fan art (figures, right??), saw this very interesting set of images of--hockey players? Hockey players--kissing?? I clicked the link, and--I fell into this completely different universe, with a full set of characters, a full, ongoing narrative, and a lively, committed fan base. Who knew?
I really LOVE Ngozi's stuff, I think she's amazingly talented--she's quite young, barely three years out of school (Yale '13) and she's really created something completely new out of--well, nothing, I guess. She wrote a dark screenplay about a collegiate hockey player who's totally in the closet, who gets injured and then becomes addicted to painkillers--I think the character comes to a sad end--and then she decided she wanted to do something different with her character, with her art (I LOVE her art!) and she wanted to do something positive rather than negative. Hence Check Please!
FYI, I went to Patreon and became one of her 'patrons'--one can give $1, $3, or $5 a month. Being a patron is different than being a subscriber, because the cartoon itself is free (although you do get the occasional 'streams' to patrons to show what she's currently doing) but I felt like I wanted to do something, to show my appreciation for her talent and her VERY positive actions.  Ngozi is originally from Texas (who then went to Yale), and her adorable gay protagonist, Bitty, is from Madison, Georgia (now going to school in Massachussetts), so you know she's doing it with insight and feeling!
Thanks Lee! I had been finding some pretty bad ( ::) ) Check Please! Fan fic, and then I found this one--loved it!--I wanted to post it here, but it was long and parts of it were a little bit, uh, steamy--so I made it a Reader's Digest version, with links, so people can read the full story.
captioning--seriously, I was that really YOU, Ngozi?
FIRST I have to say--Uhm, WHAT??
the HUSSY!! I mean rilly!!
 They were sitting right next to each other! 
Zimbits Week (Zimmermann/Bittle) was apparently a year ago, 2015. I'm with Jack--are they in a cult?? Oh well--fans always be crazy!
where you can share your talents with the whole fandom.
zimbits week has officially begun!!
(the original is 3538 words).
It’s not the first time it happens, but it’s the first time it happens after Jack hasn’t slept well, hasn’t played well.
He’s exhausted down in his bones. They haven’t had more than one day off since the beginning of February. Winter is officially thawing into spring, and Jack is tired.
On the other side of the locker room, Patty smirks and snorts a laugh.
There are whispers, because there have always been whispers. Jack doesn’t hear them, doesn’t care to listen. He goes home to his apartment and climbs into his bed and kisses at Bittle’s shoulder before tucking his knees up behind Bittle’s and exhaling. The sound of Bittle’s soft snoring is better than any noise Deadspin could make.

When Bittle kisses him, pushes into him, curls around him, wraps his hands around him, Jack’s chest gets heavy and his throat gets tight. Bittle smiles into Jack’s skin, laughs into the spot where his neck and shoulder meet. He runs his hands along Jack’s sides like he’s something delicate, something that could break but shouldn’t. He sets his feet in Jack’s lap when they’re on the couch and he drives when they go to visit Shitty in Cambridge and lets Jack leave his hand on his thigh the whole way there. He loves Jack like he deserves it, which Jack isn’t really sure about, but is something he’s willing to try to earn every single day.
“You’re gonna make the playoffs,” Bittle interrupts.
He watches Bittle’s knuckles go tight on the steering wheel, and Bittle turns to look at him, blinking at him with wide eyes. Jack says, “Watch the road,” and Bittle swears under his breath.
He puts on his signal and turns into the parking lot of a gas station. The sign says it’s at 2.217 a gallon. On the dashboard, Jack can see that the tank is three quarters full. Bittle says, “Jack,” and it comes out breathy. Jack’s not sure if it’s a question or not.
“If that’s okay with you,” Jack says, because he thought it was obvious--Bittle is half of every choice Jack makes, is the whole reason he does anything, most days. Jack thought it was obvious--he’s not in this alone.
They’re a team, and if Bittle isn’t okay with it, then that’s--that has to be fine.
Bittle says, “I--” He wrings his hands on the steering wheel.
When Jack turns to look at Bittle, he’s biting into his bottom lip, but his lips are turned up at the corners. He runs his hand under his eyes.
Jack says, “You can’t be surprised,” with a grin across his face.
The Falconers fall out in the first round.
Three days later, before the Flyers and the Penguins are set to meet, but after the first game in the series the Rangers and the Caps, Georgia and her PR team put out a small, concise statement.
Jack read it over before he gave her the okay to send it out. He’s said he’s not interested in doing any press until he and Bittle get back from Turks and Caicos.
It takes about 20 minutes after its release for the NHL PR Twitter account to post it, and after that, it’s all out in the open. It’s funny, how much a little piece of paper with a handful sentences can change so much--a few careful crafted words have now changed Jack’s life forever. Bittle’s, too. The League. Jack hopes, if anything, it changes the lives of however many kids need it--that they’ll know they aren’t alone, that they can have anything they want, that no one can stop them from chasing their dream. It’s sappy, but Jack thinks his life would have taken a much smoother path had someone blazed the trail for him.
It’s a big responsibility, but it’s one that Jack is now, finally, ready to shoulder.
He texts Shitty, can u be made free the 7-14 of july?
Shitty replies, Yeah? Just me?
Shitty says, Am I allowed to ask?
Jack smiles. check the internet , he says, because it’s the last time anyone in the world will ever be surprised by this news again in his life.
Shitty says, ?? ? !!!!!!!!! and then Jack’s phone is ringing in his hand.
Bittle comes back into the room holding an icepack, and Jack hangs up the phone after saying bye to Shitty. He says, “Here,” and holds it out to Jack. He tosses it to Jack, and Jack catches it.
“I think Shitty was crying,” Jack says. Bittle settles beside Jack on the couch, and he leans against Jack’s side.
Jack props his foot up on the coffee table, and rests his free hand on Bittle’s thigh. Bittle pinches Jack’s side, and Jack swats at him. “Hey,” he says, a little in pain and a lot in love.
“Thank you for being brave for me,” Bittle says, suddenly earnest.
Jack’s not sure he’s ever been brave in his life. He’s not sure how brave it is to let a PR team do all his dirty work. But he’s happy to do it. It feels nice, like a life-long weight has been lifted off his chest. He squeezes his hand around Bittle’s leg and scoots down on the couch to rest his head on Bittle’s shoulder.
Every time Bittle smiles at Jack, it lights Jack up from the inside. It’s been years, and it hasn’t gone away. Jack loves him, and he’s spent his whole life standing on the edge of this cliff: him and the closet and the media, and he’s happy now. He’s not afraid of jumping into it anymore, because Bittle is with him.
happy v-day, nevermindedanyway xo!
title is from taylor swift's ""jump then fall""

(the original is 15924 (!) words).
The first time Bittle tells Jack he loves him, it’s when Jack calls him after losing in Pittsburgh.
Playing against them is always rougher than it ought to be, playing against teams that his dad’s name is associated with always makes Jack’s blood itch under his skin. He’d been thrown in the box on a tripping penalty that was well deserved, even if Jack hadn’t meant to do it.
He’d left them short handed and it took all of a minute and a half for Crosby to score not once, but twice. The last thirty seconds of his time in the box had Jack’s knee bouncing, his gloved hands tight on his stick. When the penalty time ran out, he couldn’t get control of the play, and then when Bennett scored, the Falcs morale basically bottomed out part way through the third period.
“Hey,” Bittle says, soft. “Sorry,” he says.
Jack whispers, “Yeah,” but it barely makes it out of his mouth.  His dad brought Pittsburgh a cup, and it was a long time ago, but hockey fans don’t forget.
He wants to tuck his nose into Bittle’s neck, wants to feel Bittle’s hand in his hair, wants to press their skin together and just breathe the same air as him.
Minutes pass, and Jack’s chest still feels tight, but he feels less antsy, less like his insides are trying to shake their way out of his skin. He still misses Bittle more than he ever thought he would, misses his dimples and the smell of his shampoo and how he drools in his sleep. Bittle doesn’t say anything, and Jack can’t hear him doing anything on the other end of the phone, can just barely hear his quiet breathing.
“Okay,” Jack says, feeling a small smile tug at his lips.
“I meant it,” Bittle says.
Jack drives his car full of stuff from Samwell while Bittle takes Jack’s truck, drives it from Providence to Georgia and back, packs up the stuff he needs and moves out of his parents’ house for real. Jack had insured both cars under both their names last week, had Bittle’s name added to the lease on the condo.
Bittle’s mom comes up the next day, stays for four days. Jack doesn’t know much about her marriage to Bittle’s dad, but he knows that Suzanne loves Bittle with her whole heart, genuinely doesn’t care about his relationship with Jack outside of the context of Bittle’s happiness. Jack’s parents fly in on the Saturday, and they eat dinner up on the roof of the building, and Jack is nervous about it in an easy way.
The Falcs fell out of the playoffs in the second round, but it was an easier loss than last season, and Jack has enough going on in his life now that he’s managed to make sure hockey isn’t everything, tries to balance his sense of worth across different things. They had a great season, he’d formed stronger friendships with people on the team other than Sharpy.
The anxiety he feels about his parents and Bittle’s mom sitting on patio chairs, eating dinner with their plates in their laps, laughing over too many bottles of wine--it’s less like shaky limbs and more like butterflies in his stomach. They all know that Bittle and him share a bed, that they do their laundry together. They all know something intrinsic to Jack’s daily experience, to Jack’s happiness, and they’re not going to expose him, they’re not going to do anything, really, other than love him and be happy for him and try to help him in his slow and slightly embarrassing attempt to merge their families.
And Jack’s not embarrassed to love Bittle, but he sometimes feels like Bittle doesn’t understand how massive a thing it is to Jack.  Jack’s heart feels like it’s beating out of his chest on a regular basis, the enormity of his affection for Bittle blindsiding him. He’s so used to his own mental version of crisis management that it’s hard to deal with how happy he feels, how full and loved and whole he feels. It’s embarrassing only because he thinks it’s really, really obvious that he loves Bittle more than anything else, and he doesn’t question Bittle’s returned affection. But Jack stutters around it--feels flushed and too warm with it--whereas Bittle is good at knocking his shoulder into Jack when they’re in the grocery store, teases Jack and kisses Jack like the weight of it isn’t all-encompassing, and Jack doesn’t think it’ll ever be that way for him.
Tribby skates up to Jack during warm up. “Hey,” he says. “Would you be free to practice handoffs with me after?” Jack knows Triber has been feeling nervous about being moved to Jack’s line. He deserves it, though. He’s small, but he’s fast and he might be a better playmaker than Jack is himself. Jack likes him.
“Sure,” Jack says.
They set up cones around the ice, practice passing back and forth as fast as they can. Jack makes Triber do more spins than he normally would, because it’s fun, and Triber has better feet than he thinks he does.
Jack smiles, because it’s the opposite of true, and they both know it.
He shrugs, and Tribby rolls his eyes.
It’s part of being captain, Jack understands. It’s a big part of why he wanted to come out to the guys before Bittle had graduated; it’s easier for him to try to help his team, to be approachable and relatable if they know something about him.
“I know you’re faster,” Jack laughs.
Bittle is skyping with his mom when Jack walks in the door. He tosses his keys on the counter and grabs a banana from the counter before perching his chin over the back of the couch behind Bittle. He leans down to say, “Hi Suzanne,” before pecking Bittle on the cheek.
Bittle goes back to talking about whatever they were talking about when Jack interrupted, and Jack zones out a bit while listening to them. Bittle’s accent is always a bit thicker when he talks to his parents. Jack’s not sure if it’s on purpose, or if it’s just instinct. He wonders if Bittle even knows that he does it.
“I love you too, mama,” Bittle says.
“Bye,” Bittle says, and he waves, then waits for the call to end on his mom’s end before shutting his laptop. He leans back on the couch, tilts his head back so that he’s looking up at Jack, nearly upside down.  “How was practice?” he asks, mumbling against Jack’s mouth.
Bittle pulls back, straightens his neck before turning around to face Jack properly, knees pressed into the back of the couch. “Good talk?” Bittle asks as he runs his fingers softly along the side of Jack’s cheek, around the shell of his ears, down to cup at the sides of his neck.
“I mean if they haven’t said anything,” Bittle says, and he trails off. Jack kisses the corner of his mouth softly.
“Lay back,” Jack says, and Bittle moves back and Jack throws his body weight over the back of the couch, falls onto Bittle.
Bittle’s breath falls out of him in a huff, but he starts laughing, his chest shaking against Jack’s, his face pressed into Jack’s neck. “Goodness,” he says, half-choked with laughter.
“But you didn’t know before they told you,” Bittle says. “Do you think the rest of the guys’ll assume?” He pulls his arms out from under where Jack had trapped them between their bodies, splays them across the middle of Jack’s back.
“Buddies,” Bittle says, then he’s laughing again.  Bittle’s Canadian accent needs work, but Jack laughs anyway.
 To be fair, Jack’s American accent isn’t much better.
Bittle laughs, then kisses Jack’s neck softly, close lipped and sweet. “I’m glad we never did that,” he says.
Jack wedges his arm between Bittle’s side and the back of the couch, props himself up to look Bittle in the eye. “Me too,” he says, and smiles down at Bittle. “I’m glad I get to love you properly,” he says, which would be embarrassing if it weren’t so honest.

Bittle rearranges them on the couch so that they’re curled into each other on their sides. “Still love the pants offa you,” Bittle says once they’re settled again.
Jack wiggles his hips against Bittle jokingly, not really wanting to start anything--not wanting to do anything other than catalogue Bittle’s freckles from so close that he goes cross-eyed trying to count them.
There’s not really room on the couch for the two of them, but Jack feels settled and calm in a way that’s hard for him to reach, hard for him to hold onto. He doesn’t want to shatter it by suggesting they move their non-nap to their bed.
Marguerite walks up to the couch and yips once, then jumps up onto where their feet are tangled, squishes her way into the space between their legs and the side of the couch. “She’s pushy,” Bittle says, like it’s surprising, like he hasn’t been living with her for months.
“Wonder where she got that from,” Jack says. Bittle pinches his side, and Jack licks a line up the side of Bittle cheek.
this is a part of a series, and probably won't make too much sense if you haven't read the other parts, but it might still be manageable. this is going up as a wip because idrilka http://archiveofourown.org/users/idrilka/pseuds/idrilka twisted my rubber arm, so you can place praise or blame accordingly. the title of this story is taken from a novel by ronan bennett by the same name.
while this story is focused around omgcp characters, there are some name drops for the sake of hockey. ergo: here be dragons. this is a work of fiction. /// there is no allusion, mention, or appearance of pk*ne in this story.
thank you to alex and quinn for the read throughs/friendship.
FYI: Christopher Chow (""Chowder"") is a year behind Bittle, a Frosh. He is straight, has a serious girlfriend (young, volleyball athlete), he is VERY cheerful, VERY enthusiastic, even awed by his older team members, and very, VERY sensitive.
But be aware: see the yellow sticky on the laptop next to Jack's pillow? The written list item 'cadeau d'anniversaire' under Bittle's name was the beginning of the surprise birthday party Jack organized for Bittle. Aww! Jack is very, very serious, but also VERY sweet--like giving Chowder his room in the Haus.
Looking forward to the new additions!
(This artist is quite something else!
Very new, dated May 4 2016--the fan artist PAWSPAINTSNTHINGS is taking things into his/her own hands (I think it's a her--Hayley, maybe?)--and has decided to do a VERY artistic comic based on Jack's famously momentous Fourth of July visit last Summer (2015) to Bitty's parent's house in Madison, GA. Things are heating up!!
""While we wait for Madison I decided to explore it a little myself! I’m not entirely comfortable with creating comics yet, so this was a good learning experience for me.""
What does ""to chirp"" mean in the case of the panel ""Don't you chirp me Jack Zimmermann!""? I've never heard that before.
To chirps is to chat up, woo, or court another person. This is a London street slang definition.
*Boy 1* Oi bruv, that girls nice!
*Boy 2* Cherps her then!
This is what you are doing when you insult someone. You are chirping them.
Did you see Fabian chirping that guy about his mom?
Jane got chirped so badly.
Ha! Thank you, Urban Dictionary!
N: Short for romantic relationship, popularized in fanfiction circles.
V: To endorse a romantic relationship.
N: I see a 'ship developing between (Jack Zimmermann and Eric Bittle).
""The east and west sides of campus are connected by the [entirely fictional] Samwell Bridge, whose architecture is based on the [real] John Weeks Bridge at Harvard.""
See the context below--and you'll see while Jack was playfully chirping Bitty, Georgia was totally shipping the situation!
FINALLY--when the whole WORLD should have 'shipped it'--this was the same time that Jack jumped over a snow bank to waylay Bitty to ask him if he wanted to come for coffee--nearly a year after Jack missed a step and stumbled outside the Haus when he saw Bitty's bum in a small pair of running shorts. A-hem!!
That's for sure, Chuck!

Jack is not used to the Georgia heat.
While drawing this, I was thinking about the first time I visited my now-husband, then-totally-platonic-friend about 10 years ago. We lived in different countries and had only talked online until then. It was during a heat wave and I am also from The North and was not used to that kind of humidity, which contributed to my extremely fuzzy state of mind during that whole week. I was completely unable to think. Also weirdly kinda attracted to this dude and wtf, that had literally never happened before. Anyway stuff was pretty weird for a long time and it was really nothing like Bitty and Jack’s story but I was channeling some of those memories here. Mind-melting heat and the confusing/exhilarating potential of a new relationship?
FINALLY--when the whole WORLD should have 'shipped it'--this was the same time that Jack jumped over a snow bank to waylay Bitty to ask him if he wanted to come for coffee--nearly a year after Jack lost a step and stumbled outside the Haus when he saw Bitty's bum in a small pair of running shorts. A-hem!!
Thanks! Though I don't quite see how Jack was insulting Bitty!
Jack to Georgia: ""We should get going and let Bittle here text about his walk to class.""
Meaning: Bits is probably going to keep texting while walking regardless even after the little accident. Further Aside: Bittle has had some awkward moments when his teammates/frat brothers have discovered that Bitty has been (though good-naturedly) non-stop Vlogging (video blogging) and texting about his teammates' thoughts/comments/activities--to strangers.
We do too, Georgia!
Tee hee! Even Mickey and Minnie!
lmao! All about mickey mouse!
back in the thread called havoc in its third year--WELL.
Caleb Triber and Zach Webs?

Utterly adorbs! and I hope 'jack' writes more about them!
Full text, no edits, no excerpting, no nothing. 5259 words.
Click the provided link below to read the original if you prefer.
and like the previous story, they're Roomies and Buddies, got that? Ha!
Caleb is drafted the year before Zach, but he spends a year roughing it out in the minors, gets called up for a two week stint in that first season when Dartmen blows out his ankle.
Caleb was a fifth round pick. He’s fast, but he’s small, and when they call him up, he’s surprised. Dartmen’s an enforcer, which is not what Caleb was built for. But Dan throws him on a line with Samski and Lindsey Tremble, and Caleb keeps up with their speed, and he manages five points in his four games. No goals, but still. 
When he goes back down, he feels like he’s skating circles around everyone else on the ice. He manages a hat trick against Rockford, and he pushes for another three days later when they play Rochester. Doesn’t quite manage, but he nets two and gets an assist when they’re down a guy. He pushes himself to prove that he belongs back up there, belongs on the Falcs roster with Dartmen and Samski and Tremble. They need younger faces, and Caleb wants to be one of them.
The Falconers may be rough around the edges, but they wanted Caleb.  He’s not there yet; he was drafted, sure, but he’s not playing with them, doesn’t have a line. But he wants to get there, wants to make them better in any way he can.
Zach’s a first round pick, and when they’re in camp, Caleb sees why.
He’s light on his feet, and when they do a beep test on the second day, he’s the only guy who can keep up to Caleb. When they get thrown into teams to scrimmage, they’re put together.
“Well,” Zach says. “If that’s how it’s gonna be,” he says, his lips tight but turning up at the corners. “I was tryna be pals, but.” He shrugs.
Caleb winces. “Sorry,” he says. “I didn’t mean--you’re the only person who could give me a run for my money. You’re fuckin’ fast. I just--” He lifts his shoulders, and Zach smiles.
“I’m not smaller than that fucker,” Caleb says, laughing.
“Cool,” Caleb says.
 They get played on the same line during scrimmage, and they’re definitely the fastest guys on the ice. The other team has a few guys with speed, but out of everyone in the prospect camp, they’re the fastest. They get split up on the fifth day, and Caleb thinks that means bad news, one of them’ll be cut, but they’re both there the next day, and the day after that.
 He quietly proposes plays while Caleb sips at his gatorade, knocks their shoulders together when they both notice a weak point on the other side’s goaltending, cellies when they score, over and over again.
Schultzberger’s looking at them, but, whatever.  Zach’s, like, his only friend in Providence, he needs to solidify it.
Tremble nods at them. “Rooks,” he says, and Zach smiles dumbly, so Caleb nods on his behalf.
“Fuck off,” Schultzy says. “Kids,” he says. Samski comes in with his arms around Hacter and Rami, and Schultzberger gives him finger guns.  
Georgia nods. “Duly noted,” she says. “That’s it, I think. Welcome aboard, officially,” she says, and stands. Caleb shakes her hand, and her grip is tight. His palm is sweaty.
rooooooooooooomie Zach texts him later that night.
Caleb sends him back a string of house emojis.
They don’t make the playoffs, but it’s close. Tremble is two points short of winning the Art Ross, and Zach gets a Calder nomination.  Whatever, Zach can’t see.
Caleb does a Biosteel camp in Toronto, skates hard and avoids the dudes from the Bruins and puts on as much weight as he can.
His bed in his mom’s house is way smaller than the king he’s got in his condo in Providence, but it’s nice. His mom makes dinner most nights, and they spend a few days at the beach. They both read some old book about the atomic bomb, and it’s actually pretty cool, and when they’re both done, his mom recommends that Caleb read another of the guy’s books.
“A few,” she says.
“You should double check that it’s okay,” Zach says, and he sounds shy in a way that he hasn’t been with Caleb since their first road trip last October.
Caleb picks Zach and Caity up from YYZ. They drop their bags off, Caity set up in Caleb’s room, while Caleb and Zach are camped in the living room. Caleb’s already set up thermorests and pillows.
“Yas mama,” Zach says.
“Fuckin’ loser,” Caleb says, and shoulder checks him.
“It’s not your fuckin’ birthday,” Caleb says, and punches him in the arm.
“Not in my house,” Caleb says, laughing.
“Fucker,” Caleb says, even though Zach takes the left bed whenever they’re in hotels, too. Caleb doesn’t care, but it sets Zach laughing, which was basically Caleb’s whole point.

“I live for the moment,” Zach says, and salutes Caleb before going back to sipping at their bright blue fishbowl.
“Moment my ass,” she mutters under her breath. “Live for this moment,” she says before waving down their server. “Tequila shots, please,” she says.
“You’re fucked,” Caleb says, smirking at Zach, until Caity holds up three fingers.
“Three of ‘em,” she says, and the server nods.
“I don’t deserve this,” Caleb says.
“You’d like that,” Caity says.
“You’re the best big sister in the world,” Zach is saying. Caity’s sitting in the front seat of the cab, scooting the seat forward to make more foot space.
Caleb rolls down the window as the cab pulls away from the curb, closes his eyes against the breeze.
Zach laughs again before resting his head back against the seat. He’s still pressed into Caleb’s side, their legs pressed together from knee to hip. Caleb nudges Zach’s foot with his own, and Zach just presses his knee into Caleb’s with a bit more pressure.

Caity whispers, “Night boys,” before quietly climbing the stairs and going to bed.
Caleb manages to get them each a cup of water, and finds Zach laying back across both their thermorests, one hand over his eyes and the other over his stomach.
Zach drinks half the glass before handing it back to Caleb and scooting over.
“You’re gonna get too warm if you sleep in all your clothes,” Caleb says after he finishes his own water. He leans back to put Zach’s unfinished glass on the coffee table.
“Canada’s too humid,” Zach grumbles before pulling his t-shirt over his head.
Caleb falls back onto his pillow, lifts his hips to dress down to his briefs.
“You’re too humid,” he says, his eyes falling shut.
“Yeah, Dotty?” he replies without opening his eyes.
“Thanks,” Zach says.
“No prob,” he says.
“Zach,” he says, rolling onto his side to face him.
“You’re my best friend,” he says, and Caleb’s throat feels tight.
“You too,” Caleb says.
The Falcs trade their first round pick for Patrick Sharp, which would be cool except for the fact that Caleb doesn’t think he’s worth a first round pick.
“Huh,” Caleb says.
Caleb laughs. “You know you’re the only boy for me,” he says, and Zach snorts, then punches Caleb in the arm.
Caleb takes a bite of his steak and says, “you fucker,” around a mouthful.
“You love me,” Zach says, laughing.

 
Zimmermann plays on a line with Tremble and Darth, but is practically attached to Sharpy’s hip off the ice. He’s pretty quiet, but he’s friendly, and Caleb likes him well enough.
Zimmermann’s french is faster than Caleb’s, but Caleb got As in his immersion classes. “My dad’s here,” he says, looking at his skates.
“Big day, first home game,” Tremble says, and if he’s trying to calm Zimmermann down, he’s doing a pisspoor job of it.
“Yeah,” Zimmermann says.
When they line up for the anthem, Zimmermann knocks his shoulder into Caleb’s. “Thanks,” he says, quiet, and Caleb nods.
Zimmermann scores, and Caleb smashes him into the boards, Zach and Tremble following suit.
“Triber,” Bad Bob says, and Caleb does his best to beat down his nerves.
Bad Bob smiles, and Caleb’s struck by the resemblance between him and his son. Jack has his mom’s eyes, but basically everything else is Bad Bob.
Jack comes walking up the hall from the locker room with his arm around a small blond guy, and Caleb has to bite the inside of his lip to keep his breathing normal. Zimmermann looks looser around than shoulders than Caleb’s ever seen him, and he’s blushing a bit. The blond guy shoves at Zimmermann’s middle, laughing, and Zimmermann just tightens his arm around his shoulders.
When Caleb meets his eye, there’s something there, so Caleb nods. “You’re welcome to join us,” Caleb says, turning back to Bad Bob.
They’re sitting on Zach’s couch, a box of pizza open on the coffee table.  He tosses his controller down, then takes a bite of his pizza crust before tossing the rest of it onto the box’s lid.
“Jack’s kinda quiet,” Zach says.
“Just private, I think. With the drugs and then, if--” Caleb shrugs.
Zach takes a massive bite of pizza, and Caleb hopes he chokes, because he’s disgusting.
“You’re disgusting,” Caleb says. Zach grins through his food, and Caleb laughs.
Zach sprains his ankle, and Tremble’s knee gets fucked, and Caleb spends five games playing on Zimmermann’s line. 
“Oh shit,” Zach says.
“What?” Rami asks, burger half way between his plate and his mouth.
“Look at this,” he says, and holds his phone towards Caleb.
“Oh shit,” Caleb echos.
Zach says, “it’s real,” before clicking the top of his phone, the screen going back.
They go out drinking in Boston and Zimmermann spends the night plastered to the blond guy’s side. Bittle, he calls him. Sharpy takes to the kid with more enthusiasm than Caleb’s ever see, and his feelings would be hurt if he didn’t get why Sharpy was doing it. Some random girl comes up to Caleb, tries to put her hand on his knee. He removes it, shakes his head, pays for her drink anyway. Just because he’s not interested doesn’t mean his mom didn’t raise him well, he’s nice enough to treat her if he’s going to reject her for no fault of her own.
The next morning, Schultzy pulls them aside when they’re waiting to get on the bus. 
“What?” Caleb says. Zach hands him a yoghurt cup.
“Okay,” Zimmermann says, and Zach claps him on the shoulder. He makes his way back over to his stall, sits beside Caleb.
 He’s amazing to watch, amazing to share the ice with.
Off the ice, Zimmermann is miserable, scowling all the time, his knee bouncing, fingers shaky at his sides.
Zach looks up from his plate. “Why?” He takes a sip of his milk, licks at his lip.
Caleb can see Zach biting at the inside of his lip, and he looks down at his dinner.
“Zach,” Caleb says, and it comes out soft.
 “Later,” he says.
They sweep Ottawa, but Zach doesn’t say anything about it, whatever it is. If Caleb’s honest, his ears are still ringing from when he scored, and he feels like he’s vibrating out of his skin. He’s kinda forgotten.

Zimmermann breaks his stick over his knee during practice, and Dan keeps him after they all clear off the ice.
They’re supposed to be napping. They don’t play until the next day, but they need to stay in a routine as much as possible. Caleb is looking up at the ceiling, trying to make out shapes in the stucco.
“Dotty?” Caleb asks, soft, because he’s not sure if Zach’s sleeping or not.
Caleb closes his eyes, bites the inside of his lip. 

 
Zimmermann disappears into the off-season like he’s not going to be given the C next season.  
Caleb goes home and helps his mom mark final papers, reads all the ones about Slaughterhouse Five and Gatsby.
 It’s hilarious. He’s got such droopers for eyes. Poor dude, why’s he so sad if he’s so rich.
And he’s mopey too. How about that.

Caleb phones Zach on Sunday morning.
“Tribby, what’s up?
“Are you busy?” Caleb asks. He wipes his palm on his shorts, his hands too clammy.
“Just. Listen for one second.” Caleb takes a slow, even breath. Then another. 
“You’re my best friend,” Caleb says.
“You too,” Zach starts but Caleb huffs.
“Zach,” Caleb chokes.
“Okay,” Caleb says.
“I ordered dinner,” Zach says, still not making space for Caleb to come inside.
“I brought this,” Caleb says, and holds up the bottle of red.
“It’s fine,” Caleb says, and then Zach finally holds the door open wide enough for Caleb to duck under his arm and into the apartment.
“Okay,” Caleb says, slow. “I’ll just,” he waves the bottle of wine gently.
Zach pauses the game when the buzzer sounds, gets up to pay for their take-out.
Zach cackles, and Caleb’s stomach finally settles.
They do end up drinking the wine. Zach’s sitting with his legs half under him, his head leaning back on the couch, turned towards Caleb. Caleb’s got his feet up on Zach’s coffee table because he’s a horrible guest. Whatever.
“Other than me,” Zach says, like he’s sounding it out.
Caleb shrugs. “I don’t know what to say,” he says, honest, and then [Zach] reaches forward to take his wine glass from his hands. He sets it down on the table, runs the pad of his finger along Caleb’s knuckles.
Caleb wakes up in Zach’s bed, which is weird, but nice. He’s warm, and Zach is pressed into his side, using half of Caleb’s pillow. Caleb rubs at his eyes before twisting towards him. He manages to get one of his hands along Zach’s side, draws a lazy pattern of circles on the fabric of his shirt until he shifts.
“Tickles,” he says, raspy, into Caleb’s shoulder.
Caleb stops moving his hand, but doesn’t take it away.
Caleb falls back to sleep like that, his fingertips barely tracing the lines of Zach’s ribs, pressed into his side. 
Caleb inhales, and Zach smells like cinnamon, like the Old Spice he’s always worn, like laundry detergent and sweat and sunscreen. “Why,” Caleb mumbles, tightening his grip on Zach’s middle.

Maybe persuaded isn’t the right word, because when Zach lifts Caleb’s hand off his stomach and moves it to where his shirt is rucked up, to where the bare skin above his pyjamas is soft and warm, Caleb moans into the back of Zach’s neck.
“How come I’m the big spoon,” Caleb says, which. Probably poor timing, but Zach’s bigger than Caleb.

When Caleb moves his hand into the waistband of Zach’s, Zach turns his head, tries to kiss Caleb, misses his mouth and moans into Caleb’s jaw. Caleb shifts back so that Zach can roll to settle over him. Caleb’s breath catches when Zach’s lips press into his, soft and closed and a little bit chapped.
“I would,” Caleb says.
“I--Okay. Good. That’s good,” Zach says, smiling down at Caleb.

He’s been telling me about you for two years, Caity says. It’s, unfortunately, not new. Proud of you both though.
Zimmermann comes back to camp with a weird look on his face. He’s still kind of scowly, but his eyes seem lighter. He pats everyone on the shoulder, makes small talk with the newbies from prospect camp, for the guy they got when Rami was traded to Philly.
Zimmermann nods at Caleb like he always does, says, “Hey man,” like he always does. Doesn’t look at Caleb any differently.
Their first year with a named C since 2012, and they bow out of the playoffs in the second round. 
Zimmermann’s boyfriend moves in sometime around mid-July, because a bunch of them get invited to his condo for a potluck. Zimmermann’s got a curly haired dog, which surprises Caleb. The food’s amazing, they have a few beers, Zach leaves his arm around Caleb’s shoulder the whole time.
It’s no Stanley Cup, but it’s not bad.
this isn't the sequel that i mentioned; i have about a billion ideas for things that could happen in this universe, and this was just nagging me as i making dinner tonight. unbeta'd, all mistakes my own. if you play real nhl hockey, here be little dragons.

This woman. Omg.
Happy Birthday, Haylee!
Did I say it before?
WHAT a talent. Amazing!

Bitty’s couch, and he gets to make out on it. Leave me to process my loss.
I saw this couch in a little vintage furniture shop. I LOVED IT and it’s THE couch I’ve been searching for for 2 years, and I cried internally when it was so far out of my price range I couldn’t even splurge on it. So now it’s Bitty’s couch, and he gets to make out on it. Leave me to process my loss.
Hangin’ out with my fave color tonight.
Very nice kitchen indeed!
pro hockey players are, you know, rich.
I got a bug in my brain like 2 months ago to draw bitty in his dream kitchen.
I don’t do a lot of interiors, they really aren’t my strong suit, but I got a bug in my brain like 2 months ago to draw bitty in his dream kitchen. I started it and then it sat there for a long time because, interiors, but I went ahead and finished it this morning.

Jack is not actually a morning person. He gets up early because he has to, but if he had no obligations, if he didn’t have a schedule to keep or things to do or games to prepare for, Jack would happily sleep in until noon.
But Jack, against his will, gets up at six most mornings to start his day, which sometimes takes a while before he can really focus. Bitty knows this. Bitty is a morning person. 
Bitty is so good to him, sometimes Jack can’t hardly stand the feeling in his chest, like his ribcage is threatening to break from the sheer size of his heart. Bitty is so good to him, and Jack is determined to be just as good back. So he curls his arms around Bitty’s waist from behind, still fuzzy with sleep, and kisses at his neck.
He sees it before he hears it–a flash of orange fur on the counter right next to the carton of eggs. Then there’s a meow, and Jack wakes up much faster than usual.
“Delilah,” Bitty says, and Jack simply grins down at his breakfast.
animated movie...not a bad idea....
current residence: fake AND real hockey hell!
This post said “don’t think about Jack and Bitty adopting a baby and Jack passed out on the couch with their kid on his chest. Don’t do it.” So naturally I thought about it and Suffered, so I made this.
decided to draw Puck. You will probably see her again…and her future sister named Pie.
I’m obsessed with color but sometimes I play with grayscale too.
Real Life™ Jack and Bitty??
but--Eric Richard Bittle in the flesh? Wow!
But I have to say--not bad!
For Bitty's bday consider: A pie playing hockey OR A hockey stick baking.
to a startling realization.
#i'm blogging from beyond the grave #this info killed me #what a dweeb!!
Over the weekend I looked at all the canon cartoons, fantastic! Looking forward to seeing more. Thanks!
I have to start reading this weekend.
When you think about it, Chuck, it is kind of weird that, of all the characters in the omgcp (omgcheckplease!) universe, Jack only has pupils. He is also the most complex of all the characters--he is angst-ridden, self-doubting, and, in the past, most troubled (probably not suicidal, but did nearly died from an overdose)--he is also always trying to do better (and he literally has a poster on his bedroom wall that says: 'Be Better'). The eyes of the other characters are opaque, so the reader looks for facial expressions, body language, dialogue and text. When you look at Jack, you look into his eyes.
Ngozi obviously treats Jack as a special character, maybe has a bit of a crush on him (regardless he is her own creation!) but she also makes fun of his seriousness. I wish I had copied and saved three visual jokes, now I can't find them to post (drat!) but: in one alteration, she took an earlier image of Bitty wearing a frilly apron, holding a pie, looking over his shoulder, and saying 'Coming, Sweetheart!' (we assume he's saying it to You-Know-Who)--but in the alteration, Ngozi has changed the face only, from Bitty---to Jack!--and Jack's blue eyes and pupils--and it looks VERY weird! In a second, companion image, Jack is being tall, Adonis-like Jack, but his face has been changed to Bitty's cherub face. Third joke image: one of the characters is joining the whole Haus crew--and when they all turn around, SHOCK--they are all wearing huge, bugging Jack-like blue eyes with pupils boring out at the frightened viewer--very Twilight Zone, Rod Serling-type bizarre!
Alright so Jack’s pupils. We all know he’s the only one who has them clearly visible (because the others do have them, I mean they have to, otherwise this hockey team would be full of blind bros and I don’t think that would work very well on the ice) all the time through the entire comic.
I think the reason for that is that all the other characters express themselves a lot, and sometimes very loudly. Jack on the other hand, doesn’t do that, and since he probably has the body language fluidity of a zamboni, his face has to do the job of showing us (the readers) what kind of emotions he’s having inside, hence why his pupils are so important.
Jack’s pupils are contracted when in a state of shock, or fear (or both). This is probably also the state of his pupils when he’s overwhelmed by anxiety. I think his face speaks for itself: brows high and eyes wide, with his pupils contracted into an itty-bitty tiny dot.
 The difference with the semi-contracted one is very slim, the main difference being that he’s not angry, or pissed, but just “ok”.
When they are semi-dilated, Jack’s usually in a good mood and his expression is softer. His brows are a little higher and he’s usually smiling a little. I do believe it to be his “chirping face” and just overall “I’m doing good today” face.
I also have found this article about love and pupils dilatation (x), and that just confirms it for me: There’s no way Jack Zimmermann is thinking of Bitty as “just a friend” by the time he gives him this look.
That look is the look of a man in love if I’ve ever seen one.
The frenchiest and cheesiest cat lady you've ever known. This blog is now Check Please trash and cats.
LATE ADDITION: Finally found this!

All I have to say is--WOW.

Lukas Graham is a Danish pop band consisting of vocalist Lukas Graham Forchhammer(born September 18, 1988), drummer Mark ""Lovestick"" Falgren (born November 28, 1988), bassist Magnus Larsson (born September 9, 1990) and keyboardist Kasper Daugaard (born June 14, 1989). Launching their debut album in 2012 on Copenhagen Records, Lukas Graham quickly became a popular live act in Denmark. That success translated to the rest of Europe and caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records who co-signed them in 2013. The band’s music was first introduced worldwide with the release of their two singles ""Mama Said"" and ""7 Years"", the latter of which topped various international charts. Their second album was released internationally on April 1.
More Than This is the debut album by American alternative rock band The Age of Information, known then as 'Trading Yesterday'. It was professionally recorded in Los Angeles, however due to the band departing from Epic Records, was shelved and never released. It was leaked for download over the Internet in December 2006, where it gained a fanbase. In 2010, David Hodges re-acquired the album rights from Epic Records, after which he officially released the album in September 2011, though the official release does not include the track, ""World On Fire"". The album contained seven tracks from the band's demo, The Beauty and the Tragedy, but are longer on this album and have more backing instrumental added.
The album has since been officially released on September 8, 2011, with the track ""World On Fire"" removed.
The Age of Information (formerly known as ""Trading Yesterday"") is an American alternative rock band originally formed in 2002 by David Hodges and Mark Colbert, and later joined by Steven McMorran. In 2004, The Age of Information released a demo CD titled The Beauty and the Tragedy, and after signing with Epic Records later that year, they released their first single, ""One Day"", in the summer of 2005, along with an announcement for the upcoming album ""More Than This."" After a premature end to their contract with Epic Records, the album ""More Than This"" was shelved until 2011, when it was finally released independently by David Hodges' Sleepwalker Records.

and expected to live by themselves.
WASHINGTON, DC–If there’s been a running theme for this year’s Winter Classic, it’s the closeness of the hockey community.
With the passing of Blackhawks assistant equipment manager Clint Reif a few weeks ago, the game has taken a back seat to focus on the relationships that make it so important. Reif’s passing showed how quickly that community can come together to honor one of its own.
But the other relationship that’s shined is that of Capitals forwards Tom Wilson and Michael Latta, a bromance that rivals any in the league.
If you’ve been watching ‘Road to the Winter Classic’ you’ve seen Wilson and Latta, two physical forwards with a knack for finding the penalty box, at their best. Whether it’s showing off the impressive contents of their bachelor fridge (mostly ketchup bought at Costco) or discussing Matthew Mcconaughey in Interstellar, the bond is undeniable.
Before the Winter Classic at Nationals Park, Wilson talked about the duo’s bond and their star turn on the reality series. The Capitals, once a team filled with young single guys, now has more family men, leaving them somewhat the odd men out.
Wilson said he and Latta had a lot of mutual friends through the hockey community, but didn’t know each other till last year. After spending time together stuck in hotel rooms while on the road, they two bonded easily.
Wilson says the portrayal of their friendship on ‘Road to the Winter Classic’ is also true to life.
The Washington Capitals let Tom Wilson and Michael Latta loose on their Twitter account Tuesday night. The roommates unleashed an endless barrage of tweets, answering questions and commenting on the final episode of EPIX’s Road To The Winter Classic (EP:RttWC?).
The friends, known for their chirping, made fun of everyone and everything they came across, including themselves. Below are some of our favorites.
Boys are ready. Start sending fun questions using #CapsRoomies now!
""Look!! It's the Bromance boys!
Tom Wilson and Michael Latta.""
""Pictured here with teammate Michael Latta, like the moon is pictured with the Sun.""

vday gift for lilbookofkell!! reeeaaaally loved your fic btw!
they didn't know was that they were actually starring in the video!
Watch below to see what happens…""
Sold out shows in London, Paris, Los Angeles, Amsterdam and New York a week after their debut album release marked the beginning of the band's touring career.
(the ending is terrific, by the way).
at providing both, if he says so himself.
Two weeks later, Jack Zimmermann knocks on his door and presents him with a honest-to-god cassette tape, hand-labeled and everything, and a working cassette player to go with it.
“Where on earth did you even get this?” Eric demands after he’s finally stopped laughing.
“Nursey has some friends who are really into vintage stuff,” Jack informs him. He looks so damn pleased with himself that Eric just has to kiss him.
And then pull him into his room.
And onto his bed.
A hour or so later, Jack is napping in his bed and and Eric is running his finger over Jack’s neat handwriting on the front of the tape. It’s a good selection of songs, a nice mix of top 40 and 90’s pop and country and even 'I’ll Cover You' from Rent which Jack had to have learned about from Holster. He recognizes at least one song from his parent’s mixtape mix and has to stop himself from waking Jack up just so he can kiss him again.
Jack made him a mixtape and Eric can’t stop smiling. He wants to tell someone. Anyone. Everyone. Neither of them is ready to be out to anyone but their closest friends and Jack’s a public figure for god’s sake so he knows it’s ridiculous and irresponsible and impossible but he wants to tell the whole wide world that this socially-awkward, beautiful, hockey-robot who is his boyfriend made him a mixtape.
He wants to tell his mom.
He dismisses the thought right away. There’s no way he can tell his mother that his boyfriend made him a mixtape. And then he thinks about it again. He’d told his mother about the initial mixtape story. He could tell her it was just a follow up for that. That Jack had gone through the trouble of making a real, live mixtape just to tease him. It’s a stretch to be sure, especially given the way that the first mixtape conversation had ended. She’ll probably suspect something but...but maybe dropping a hint or two wouldn’t be so bad.
He grabs his phone off his desk before he can change his mind. He’s just decided that doing this as a text message is probably his best bet when he notices he has a new text message. From his mother. It’s from about twenty minutes ago, when he and Jack were, well, busy, so they hadn’t heard the phone buzz. His mom has a habit of treating text messaging like email so he’s not surprised that the the message is too long to read in the notification preview. He clicks to view the whole thing.
Hi sweetie! Hope you’re having a good day. I finally managed to get Nancy to share her banana bread recipe with me so make sure you check your email for that! Also Sarah called earlier and wanted our opinion on food for the wedding reception so you should give her a call at some point.
He doesn’t want to wake Jack but his headphones are in his bag across the room and Jack’s arm is pretty snuggly slung across his waist so there’s really only so much he can do. He turns the volume down low and clicks on the link.
He’s never heard of the artist but that doesn’t surprise him; he hasn’t actively kept up with country music since middle school. The beginning of the video starts in silence with cliched clips of a highway and the desert, which doesn’t exactly set Eric’s expectations very high. The music starts and it’s a little louder than he thought it would be and he quickly turns the volume down some more.
The singer starts in, singing about if a woman saves herself for marriage she’s a prude but if she doesn’t she’s a whore, and Eric finds himself a little bit more intrigued. If nothing else maybe he can send the song along to Shitty.
The chorus starts and Eric is so busy rolling his eyes at the singer’s cheesy outfit that he almost misses it. He has to replay the line three times before he’s sure.
Kiss lots of boys, or kiss lots of girls if that’s something you’re into.
That...that does not sound like an appeal to straight guys to identify with this song. Eric’s heart is beating a little faster as he lets the song continue.
When the straight and narrow...
Gets a little too straight...
He lets the song play all the way to the end and then plays it again while he looks up the lyrics, just to be sure. Then he plays it a third time. He’s so caught up in listening that he doesn’t even notice Jack stirring beside him until Jack’s chest is pressed up against his back and there are arms wrapping around his torso.
“Good song,” Jack says, hooking his chin over Eric’s shoulder. Eric supposes he should feel bad about waking his boyfriend but he’s finding it hard to when he really needs this hug right now.
They’re quiet for a minute. Jack’s fingers are idly tracing patterns into Eric’s stomach. He probably doesn’t realize he’s doing it, but it’s comforting nonetheless.
“I think…” Eric starts, and then stops when he realizes he really doesn’t know what he wants to say. Jack waits patiently for him to continue. Finally Eric gestures toward his phone.
“Do mind if I…” he trails off again but Jack somehow seems to understand.
Eric shakes his head and Jack reaches for his free hand, the one not holding his phone, and intertwines their fingers.
Eric gives him a watery smile before turning back to his phone. He takes a deep breath and calls his mother.
She picks up almost immediately.
His mom makes a pleased noise on the other end of the line and Eric feels a little bit of the tension in his shoulders slip.
This is the longest thing I've written since high school because I am in way too deep with this comic. Also there is not nearly enough frogs in this fic, for which I deeply apologize.
I'm lilbookofkell on tumblr if you want to chat.
This was written before Ngozi's comic entry 2.6 - WGSS120 / HIST376: Women, Food, & American Culture. This pulls some stuff from the twitter as well but I decided to ignore #EpiKegster's existence since I couldn't possibly guess at what actually happens during it.
Kacey Lee Musgraves (born August 21, 1988) is an American country singer and songwriter. She self-released three albums before appearing on the fifth season of the USA Network's singing competition Nashville Star in 2007, where she placed seventh. She signed to Mercury Nashville in 2012 and has released two critically acclaimed albums on the label, Same Trailer Different Park (2013) and Pageant Material (2015). Musgraves later announced dates for her new tour 'The Kacey Musgraves Country & Western Rhinestone Revue' which began August 27, 2015 in Atlanta and wrapping in Amsterdam on November 22. Many tour stops were sold out so on January 11, 2016 Musgraves announced the 2nd leg of the tour which begins January 21, 2016 through April 22, 2016 respectively.
but what if NO ONE already knows and they just slip up one time??
and then jack has to give each of them a kiss too.
with some loophole because I don’t have the money for a new one).
I needed to draw a boy in short shorts.
Sketching traditionally tonight since my tablet’s on the fritz.
I’m not entirely happy with this, but hey you win some you lose some.
Plus I promised a traditional sketch of Jack a long time ago.
than yesterday’s attempt. So…Jack’s next!
Sketchin’ Realistic Bitty.
Growing up, my best friend and I would stay up all night filling sketch books.
We have giant storage tubs of all of our middle and high school sketches.
Hey guys! So, at this point I’m just waiting to hear back from my tablet’s company about what they’re willing to do about my dead tablet. At best they’ll send me a new one, but I’m guessing I’ll have to ship my current one back to them. Wait for them to fiddle with it and fix it, and send it back. If that’s the case I may be looking at a long wait before I can draw with my tablet again. 
I’m absolutely itching to draw and work on fanart, and one particular fancomic I’m collaborating on. But Alas. I might do some traditional stuff but I don’t super enjoy doing my fanart style in that medium. I might get desperate though since fanart is a huge part of my self care system and now over a week without it and I can tell the difference.
I hope you don’t mind some more dog stuff in the meantime?
They emailed me back!
Why Do Queer People Write Fan Fiction?
To See Themselves in Mainstream Culture.
Why shouldn't Kirk be with Spock, Knope with Perkins, or Stark with Rogers?
Being a queer consumer of entertainment is a little like being a diabetic invited to an ice-cream social: It’s fun until it starts to hurt, and at some point you’ll inevitably feel left out. While some media seem to be moving further ahead than others—see the influx of TV shows like Transparent, Sense8, and Orange Is the New Black, which feature queer characters from a range of backgrounds—as long as Hollywood is still making movies like Stonewall, where white cisgender men are insistently transformed into ahistorical heroes, representation is still a problem. For many queer viewers, favorite movies and TV shows offer a world in which complex, dynamic, actively queer people—people like them—do not exist.
However, as history has taught us, queer folk can always make a space for themselves, even in the most hostile of conditions. Fan fiction (or fanfiction, fan fic, fic, or any of number of abbreviations used around the web) is a term that can cause a lot of spontaneous eyerolling and sarcasm-flinging in some circles, but in others, it’s a tradition that has long united fan communities. Using characters, settings, plots, or any combination of these elements, amateur writers reimagine existing works—fiction and nonfiction—in new ways. The Brontë sisters wrote “fantasy stories” about the Duke of Wellington, and expanding upon the Sherlock Holmes canon has been a professional pastime for dozens of published writers. Nowadays, most fan fiction is on the internet, accumulated in vast archives like Archive of Our Own (Ao3) and FanFiction.net.
Fan fiction empowers authors because, in a longtime fan fiction writer’s words, “It doesn’t have limits, and it doesn’t prescribe them.” With the basic foundations already laid, fan fiction authors can change anything they don’t like about the original story by adding, removing, or inventing at will. Missed moments, new romances, alternate universes where their favorite characters are talking squirrels who live in a magic oak tree—or, perhaps, where two canonically straight characters are in a queer relationship.
Actually, there’s not much perhaps about it. Queer fan fiction, or slash—a term usually used for male/male stories, femslash for women—goes right back to the roots of modern fan fiction, when fan magazines in the 1960s published pulpy romances between Star Trek ’s Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock. (If that surprises you, you’ve clearly never seen the way William Shatner used to look at Leonard Nimoy.) The majority of television’s and movies’ most popular franchises are full of characters whose heterosexuality is unquestioned, but that doesn’t kill the chemistry that can arise between well-written characters and talented actors. In those instances, queer audiences long for same-sex characters to have an equal shot at romance or at least an approach to queerness that isn’t “all-or-nothing”—something a little like bisexuality, for example, which has recently been acknowledged and realistically portrayed on several television shows (hello, American Horror Story: Hotel, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, and Orange Is the New Black), but sadly remains pretty scarce in movies.
One writer of slash fan fiction, who wished to remain anonymous—professing, like many I interviewed for this article, to being “ashamed” of her involvement with the fan fiction community—pointed to the double standard between onscreen romances for straight and queer couples. “The sort of love stories I like are totally reflected and visible in [mainstream media’s] canon straight romances,” she said. “Professionally produced media doesn’t give me that sort of well-written, emotionally devastating love story with LGBT+ characters.” The eroticism, the passion, the high stakes—in most cases, these are all reserved for straight characters. It’s up to the queer fans to claim them for themselves.
Take, for instance, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where the superpowered members of the Avengers are mostly male, toned as hell, and love to banter: Right out of the gate, fans were eagerly exploring the possibilities of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, and Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, becoming lovers. On Ao3, there are almost 10,000 stories pairing the two romantically; that’s 3,000 more than the next most popular pairing, which also features two male characters in a queer relationship (Agent Coulson and Hawkeye). Parks and Recreation, one of television’s most beloved sitcoms, has more stories that romantically pair protagonist Leslie Knope with her female best friend, Ann Perkins, than with her husband, Ben Wyatt. And in case you were wondering, Shakespeare fan fiction does exist, and yes, Henry IV’s Prince Hal does fall in love with his childhood friend Ned.
This re-pairing of characters can be written off as unsatisfied fans indulging in wish fulfillment and the occasional erotic daydream. Outsiders who have ventured into the world of fan fiction—including Slate ’s David Plotz and Laura Miller—have struggled to remain neutral while describing the genre, referring to an “obsession with emotional intensity” that has “spawned slash” or raising eyebrows at “romances, often torrid, between ostensibly straight male characters.” But when you are a member of the product’s original target audience—when you identify with characters whose sexualities are socially approved and unthreatening—you are much less likely to understand how empowered one can feel when writing queer romance into straight stories. There is power in giving Harry Potter a crush on Draco Malfoy, or creating a world in which Scandal ’s Olivia and Mellie leave Fitz for each other; there is power in creating a means by which those in the mainstream might see from your sidelined point of view. It’s easy to trivialize, but the fact is that fan fiction is one of the few outlets that an increasingly frustrated queer audience has to engage with material that refuses to engage with them.
Authors of queer fan fiction make no bones about the fact that their work has political and social implications. “[Queer fan fiction] turns an essential but societally marginalized part of our identities into a tool for creating real and recognized art,” insists one fan fiction author. You don’t have to be queer to appreciate queer fan fiction, or even to write it—in fact, a recent census of Ao3 showed that at least one-third of slash fan fiction authors identify as heterosexual—but, as many writers will tell you, it helps to know the scene before you write about it.
In populist media like film and television, the history of queer representation is one long yellow brick road of insulting punchlines, drag queen gags, and after-school specials. Queer characters are traditionally relegated to secondary status and only brought into focus when storylines touch on topics of sexuality.  Indeed, increasingly out-of-date standards are a huge part of the problem as TV and film have struggled to toe the line between groundbreaking and offensive. The most obvious example that comes to mind is Will & Grace ’s Jack McFarland, who was once a trailblazer but now appears to us as a screaming bundle of stereotypes. McFarland’s original portrayal was bold and proud in a time when queer men were invisible; now that visibility is no longer quite as limited a commodity, starting and ending at the extremes is a poor strategy for representing the vast expanse of queer identity.
Menzosarres’ criticism delivers direct hits to several tender spots in the fan fiction community. In part because the entertainment industry continues to be overwhelmingly dominated by white and cisgender actors, as well as by programming that relegates actors of color and trans actors to “niche” projects, there is far less fan fiction exploring characters of color and transgender characters in the same depth as white, cis ones. In the same way queer authors will write queerness into straight-dominated universes, authors of color may do the same with countless white-dominated narratives. And the exclusion of women is an all-around problem: Misogynistic inequality, racism, and violence pervades fan fiction just as it pervades the source material.
When you see the words authorial and authority so close together in the same sentence—referring to the same interest, no less—it may be a little jarring. Many writers’ rooms are full of people who have worked incredibly hard for the chance to tell one story, let alone an entire season, and their creative impulses are tightly controlled by networks and producers. It is unlikely that any of them feel more authoritative than the writers who post to fan fiction forums.
And yet, their stories are the ones that reach millions. Their stories come to life. And those lives belong to straight white people. Make no mistake, a straight white character can still be extremely compelling and well-written; but for viewers of color, for queer viewers, for everybody out there who is tired of their culture and identity being treated as a passing thought, fan fiction represents something crucial. It represents a challenge to the notion that being created in a straight world means one must live a straight life—a notion that queer people have been fighting forever. It represents an outlet of expression that begins on a populist level and hasn’t yet stopped. It represents a refusal to be punchlines anymore, a refusal to express ourselves less because it’s more convenient for everyone else.
In writing fan fiction, we do more than rewrite our favorite stories. We take those stories and make them strong enough to handle people like us.

Ohh, Jack as a cowboy.....
I think there was at least a second piece of Jack (Zimmermann, not Twist) as cowboy Fanart, but I couldn't find it again, so--here, I'll pick a couple of likely candidates from Google Images, and--voilà, a gen-u-ine Québécois/Quebecer cow-boy, le vacher, le bouvier and moutons herder!
LOL...............Bitty's eyes say it all.

Check Please! needlepoint?
Wow! VERY Bayeux Tapestry!
doing Jack’s pants then I’ll probably move onto Bitty’s clothes.
are they playing ice hockey?
and their hockey-robot boyfriends.
main is kinkybucky.
The give and take of Jack and Bitty’s relationship gets me every time alright.
Bitty, he’s good with his words. He can express his emotions freely and fully and knows just what to say (or knows not to say anything at all) to help a situation. When Jack is caught up in his own head or needs to just hear him talk, Bitty always knows exactly what to say. Jack thrives with this. Every time Bitty calls him Honey or Sweetheart or says “I’m so proud of you”, Jack falls in love all over again.
And Jack, on the other hand, can barely string together a sentence if it has any hint of emotion. And it’s not that he doesn’t want to, because, god, does he want to. He just doesn’t even know where to start. So instead, Jack expresses himself through touch. A casual arm slung across someone’s shoulder, holding Bitty in private, casual hip-checks and hugs between friends.
But physicality is one of Bitty’s weak points, especially with Jack. He’s spent his entire life hiding, and he never quite shakes the fear that comes with holding hands in public. And sometimes, sometimes it’s just a matter of not wanting to be touched, childhood memories flooding back. Jack helps the most with those moments.
And then there’s Jack’s devotion and Bitty’s support. Jack loves fully, completely, at an intensity he didn’t even know existed before Bitty. It’s so strong he can’t hide it, so he doesn’t even bother trying. Bitty absolutely loves this, loves the attention and reassurance that yes, he’s wanted, he’s being loved back. This is real and happening and it’s so much better than he ever thought.
Bitty helps Jack in more ways he will ever know. He grounds him, calms his fears and worries and makes him feel whole with every soft kiss. Bitty doesn’t fix him, no, but Jack does find that laying his head on Bitty’s chest while listening to him ramble on about all the ridiculous things he can think of, that Bitty quiets his thoughts more than any pill ever did.
And there’s more. There’s so much more. Jack being the spontaneous romantic that gets Bitty laughing and crying every time, and Bitty making Jack’s heart swell with all the little things. How Bitty is like a goddamn sunshine when he walks into the room and Jack is the ocean in the middle of the night, strong and intense and beautiful. They fit so well together and it is so, so wonderful to see.
NSFW (the for realz nsfw kind) zimbits under the cut.
i’m gonna be brave and close my eyes and hit post.
Ask and ye shall receive anon.
Thanks, Jeff, for taking the time to comment. I agree. I think the artist, Haylee Y. is something special. It seems that in her 'day job' she works with animals, dogs particularly, and helps rehabilitate them. I think it's obvious why her empathy, sympathy, sensitivity really make her art (which is already very high caliber) so alive.
This is one of my favorites (which I posted earlier in this thread, on page 5).
THANKS SO MUCH TO @urbanhymnal for the dialogue.
Lots of death and trauma…both direct and secondary.
SO……hurt comfort happened.
but nobody puts hurt/comfort in the corner.
You're welcome, John. I just can't get over that image. I don't know how to explain it. Obviously they're having sex, yet somehow the image isn't the least bit prurient--or, at least, I don't find it prurient anyway. And I don't feel like I'm ""spying"" on them--and that doesn't have anything to do with them being comic characters and not ""real people."" Maybe the use of color in the image has something to do with it.
It sort of makes me want to cry.
At long, long, long last! Omg, Ngozi's nearly as bad as George R.R. Martin!
Oh no! :'( This is what I was afraid of!
I had to do a thing before I could sleep….
 Though this comic is filled with warm fuzzies and classy humor, it has a protagonist, and protagonists need to struggle. And since ours is a tiny defenseless big-eyed pie-baking angel-child, it’s difficult to watch him suffer.  Remember that time Jack was a petty dingus?  There’ll be CP! updates that will make you have “all of the feels : ) : ) : )” and updates that will make you have “holy shit ALL of the feels take them away FUCK”. I can guarantee that Bitty’s story is ultimately a happy one. SERIOUSLY. 
Check, Please! Updates this week!

I needed to process stuff out tonight. Sorry, boys.
I must admit, I never remember to come back and look for updates, so I'm glad you keep the the thread active.
They are coming at last, Chuck! Not only that, Ngozi is starting a new, very ambitious Kickstarter!
The fans taking it to a higher level as usual--FYI for French class!
I would like to thank the Québecquer who helped N with this one.

Thank you for the commission!! I really appreciate all of them.
friday is payday, and then it's off to her GoFundMe.
otakusapien asked: Do you ideas for other stories you want to write after this, or is all your attention focused on Check Please for now?
- I’d love to write a story about a sports reporter–roughly based on m’girl Jemele Hill. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemele_Hill ) Here’s a bit of a pitch–Lara is a popular a female sports vlogger who is as incendiary as she is insightful! One thing that she doesn’t do is makes game predictions. Why? Because she’s never made a wrong one. Ever. Like, ever. Since she was like, 7. It’s a bit of super power.
But for now, I’ve got about 1.5 years of Eric Bittle’s story to churn out!
cityelf asked: What would you say to anyone wanting to start an ambitious art project/series but is reluctant because either they think it'll be too much for them to cope with, or nobody will care?
1. You will care. You should work on a story because you’re obsessed with it and for no other reason. When I eventually draw my Grand Boostle Opus, I can guarantee you that very few people will care about this modern superhero AU where two friends fight crime and save the world (and fall in love)??
But haha. Oh. Oh, I will care.
2. Start Small. Don’t start ambitious art projects if ambitious art projects seem scary to you. Start small ones.
If I remember correctly, I only meant for Check, Please! to be about 4 or 5 comics that I would work on over the summer.
that’s what you get for sleeping at the Haus, Nursey. That’s where the drama happens.
You just know Señor Bunny has been the fly on the wall/stuffed bunny on the pillow from the beginning, and he has seen it all.
you know this is bound to happen sooner or later.
Looks like Jack liked it, so he put a ring on it.
@spacetimeandmatter, I HAD TO DO IT!
You know how much hockey players make? Sidney Crosby (who looks a LOT like our Mr. Zimmermann), who is 29 years old, made 15 MILLION US DOLLARS--in 2015.

Well, NO, apparently NOT!! DUH!!!!!
a grammatical mistake in speech or writing.
a breach of good manners; a piece of incorrect behavior.
I’m just confrontation-averse, and I see people getting het up about this. But let us come together as a fandom and know this Cool Thing That Will Improve Our Characterisation. Please?
Folks from Quebec will not use Québécois to refer to their own language. Folks outside of Quebec, including other parts of Canada and a lot of the US (and, based on the French folk I know, them too) will likely refer to it as such.
Shitty: But, brah, your mom’s American.
Jack: That doesn’t invalidate the other half of my heritage or experience, Shits.
Consider me educated.
But the problem is that french canadians (outside of quebec) are a marginalized population and already have to deal with their language being mocked and lacking prestige. When we call it french we do it to remind people that its still the same language that all francophones speak, just a different dialect. I know I’ve done it but it’s hard to compare “quebecois vs french” to “american vs english” bc anglophones/americans have an enormous amount of privilege and calling it “american” is seen as a joke whereas calling it “quebecois” takes away a huge part of our history and culture. And tbh – quebecois people within quebec have also a huge amount of privilege compared to other francophone canadians, because their french is often seen as “better” than the rest (and they have more ressources/bigger population) so to call it quebecois instead of french just puts them on a different level, again.
Basically: if you’re not french canadian, listen to french canadians. Every one I’ve spoken to about this doesn’t call it québécois.
That being said and understood, I would love to see this conversation happen in fic format. Not just because I adore fic, but because “how to properly characterise French Canadians” as a lesson to the fandom is more likely to stick around longer on AO3 than via a tumblr post that gets reblogged in its various incarnations.
Not only could we have History Buff Jack talking to Shits about it (Shitty History with Jack Zimmermann, but there could be discussion with Ransom about differing Canadian attitudes about the language and the culture (FRENCH SHIT with Ransom and Jack), maybe Jack talking to Nursey about the differences between spoken and written French in Quebec and the fraught history there, and also a side scene where Jack embarrassedly explains why he doesn’t use French swears in the bedroom. Some not-Quebec French Canadian scenes with a Falconer might also be cool– Acadien D-man Étienne “Savvy” Savoie (although I’m coming up with that name based on my Cajun French background)?
So um, yes.

I love that Dido song!
Peach – ""On My Own""
British singer Dido's song ""Thank You"" made its appearance on the soundtrack, becoming a hit three years later. It was a commercial for this film featuring. The song eventually hit no. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
Aqua's song ""Turn Back Time"" was released as a single in 1998 and topped the UK Singles chart. The music video is heavily based on the movie and featured scenes from it.
This soundtrack is notable as the last from a Paramount film to be released by MCA Records, which, as successor to Paramount's former record division, continued to release soundtracks for some Paramount films starting in 1979. In 2003, when Geffen Records absorbed MCA and became another successor to the former record division of Paramount, it began to share the duty of issuing Paramount film soundtracks with sister labels Interscope and A&M.
An important omission from the soundtrack is the Patty Larkin cover of ""Tenderness on the Block"" that plays during the final scene. Due to copyright and recording issues, this track was never released and is only available in the movie.
in case. Character requests are ON HOLD.
A side note about Dido's song.
When ""No Angel"" was released, ""Thank You"" was passed over to be the lead single, and instead ""Here With Me"" was released, and it went Top 10. The CD's second single flopped, but just at that time, rapper Eminem had released his (then) latest CD, and the lead single was ""Stan"". ""Stan"" is about an obsessed fan who is stalking Eminem and becoming unhinged. The lines that open ""Thank You"" became the chorus for ""Stan"", with Dido's voice used in the sample, and Dido plays the obsessed fan's girlfriend in the video.
All the attention that ""Stan"" received (due to the violent ending of the song) spread to ""Thank You"" and it was released as Dido's third single, and it followed ""Here With Me"" into the Top 10.
Be aware, the video contains adult language which is not edited out.
The Little Mermaid was considered by some as ""the film that brought Broadway into cartoons"". Alan Menken wrote the Academy Award winning score, and collaborated with Howard Ashman on the songs. One of the film's most prominent songs, ""Part of Your World"", was nearly cut from the film when it seemingly tested poorly with an audience of school children, who became rowdy during the scene. This caused Jeffrey Katzenberg to feel that the song needed to be cut, an idea that was resisted by Musker, Clements, and Keane. Both Muscker and Clements cited the similar situation of the popular song ""Over the Rainbow"" nearly being cut from 1939's The Wizard of Oz when appealing to Katzenberg. Keane pushed for the song to remain until the film was in a more finalized state. During a second test screening, the scene, now colorized and further developed, tested well with a separate child audience, and the musical number was kept.
and for me to get back on topic, my two ""Check, Please"" books have arrived.
I'm way behind! Now catching up from just before Christmas!
Totally what the note says 100%.
Again--How did I miss Valentine's Day??
""one” gift for him.
Watercolor, Colored Pencil, Gouache.
great purchase, John!!!
they’re in love, really, i swear--Snuggle frogs!!!!!
just an anxious brown forest kid.
Hey there, I'm Jade!
I love Check Please!
so if you get a follow, that's me!
so many boys!
Obviously, referencing Dax's, well, maybe, freckles??
My t-shirt arrived, and I love it! It's really well made, nicely printed, and 100% cotton. It feels great and, in person, it looks sharp! Definitely better than the photo!
it's all about the pie!
damn, that's a lot of jam!!!
fanart is always welcome!
Hockey is partly about luck, baking is all about skill, and Bitty has both!
who THIS is??
""There's fan art, and people are cosplaying it,"" Beth David of In A Heartbeat said.
""They're sending us GIFs and edits. That's crazy! We're blown away, and it's so exciting.""
Well, I'm glad Chuck--you'll be pleased that Ngozi has just pushed out one more before Christmas--a two-parter (12 panels, but no dialogue). Scroll below!
You just knew it was coming down to game 7!
WOOOPS!!!! I can't believe it, but it looks like Ngozi is going to pop out another installment, 3.25 (SEASON 3: JUNIOR YEAR, #25) on Christmas! A big one!
And I think it's going to be Very Emotional--but we shall see--!
This is a PREVIEW (in 2 parts), it is not really out yet, but I don't care, I can't stand it, I'm posting it now and I'll correct as need be. Sorry, Ngozi!
Similarly: Tronnie's Fanart!
There's a ton of fan art about this series. It really has caught a lot of people's attention.
True that! But--take a look--Ngozi has come out with ANOTHER installment (definitely the last of the year)--WOAH!
Quick note: Hey patrons! Hope you enjoy the last comic of the year! This is the most complete version I have but I still have to go back and make a few edits. (I.e. some of the text will change but it’s way too late to put Parse’s watch on the right wrist ahhh) I’m literally still traveling!

### Soma Kwa Ajili ya Somo la Juma Hili
Ufunuo 4, Eze. 1:5–14, Ufunuo 5, Efe. 1:20–23, Ebr. 10:12, Mdo 2:32–36.

> <p>Fungu la Kukariri</p>
> “Yeye ashindaye, nitampa kuketi pamoja nami katika kiti changu cha enzi, kama mimi nilivyoshinda nikaketi pamoja na Baba yangu katika kiti chake cha enzi”(Ufunuo 3:21).

Njozi iliyopita ilionesha jumbe za Kristo kwa watu Wake duniani. Sasa njozi inahama kutoka duniani kwenda mbinguni na kujikita katika “mambo ambayo hayana budi kuwako baada ya hayo” (Ufu. 4:1)—wakati ujao.

Njozi ya sura ya 4-5 hutupatia mandhari ya mfululizo wa matukio ya pambano kuu. Ikiwa hivyo, kama Ufunuo 12 ilivyo, tukio la sura ya 4-5 kiishara huonesha historia ya mpango wa wokovu, ikianzia huduma ya Kristo duniani. Kabla wakati ujao haujadhihirishwa, hata hivyo, tunapewa mdokezo wa uzinduzi wa Kristo kuingia katika huduma Yake mbinguni baada ya Kalvari. Kwa namna hiyo, sura ya 4-5 hutupatia mtazamo wa mbinguni kuhusiana na maana ya matukio yajayo yaliyorekodiwa katika sehemu iliyobaki ya kitabu hiki.

Mtu anaweza pia kugundua kwamba wakati ambapo jumbe kwa makanisa saba ziliandikwa kiasi fulani kwa lugha ya moja kwa moja, kuanzia sasa na kuendelea kitabu hutumia lugha ya kiishara ambayo si rahisi kufafanua wakati wote. Lugha hii huchukuliwa kutoka kwenye historia ya watu wa Mungu, kama ilivyorekodiwa katika Agano la Kale. Ufafanuzi sahihi wa Ufunuo huhitaji uelewa sahihi wa lugha yake ya kiishara kwa mujibu wa Agano la Kale.

"<reponame>RyanMcCarl/.emacs.d
These are just examples that I use for testing lentic interactively.
Each one tests a single transformation. There are some big examples aslo for
performance testing.

Most of these files define their configuration in a file local variable.
Sensible in this case, because we have lots of files of different types in one
directory. In practice, there is likely to be a single kind of lentic file in
one directory, so this would be set with a dir-local variable. A couple of the
files have no configuration, and will use the default configuration.

The real test case data is in dev-resources.

# <a name=""tutorial-create-an-aspnet-core-app-with-vue-in-visual-studio""></a>Samouczek: tworzenie aplikacji ASP.NET Core za pomocą aplikacji Vue w programie Visual Studio

W tym artykule dowiesz się, jak utworzyć projekt interfejsu ASP.NET Core, który będzie pełnił usługę zaplecza interfejsu API, oraz projekt Vue, który będzie działać jako interfejs użytkownika.

Obecnie program Visual Studio szablony ASP.NET Core jednostronicowej (SPA), które obsługują Angular, React i Vue. Szablony zapewniają wbudowany folder Aplikacji klienckiej w projektach ASP.NET Core, który zawiera podstawowe pliki i foldery poszczególnych platform.

Począwszy od Visual Studio 2022 (wersja zapoznawcza 2), można użyć metody opisanej w tym artykule, aby utworzyć ASP.NET Core jednostronicowe, które:

- Umieść aplikację kliencyjną w oddzielnym projekcie, poza projektem ASP.NET Core projektu
- Tworzenie projektu klienta na podstawie interfejsu wiersza polecenia struktury zainstalowanego na komputerze

## <a name=""prerequisites""></a>Wymagania wstępne

Upewnij się, że zainstalowano następujące elementy:

- Visual Studio 2022 (wersja zapoznawcza 2) lub nowszy z zainstalowanym **ASP.NET tworzenie aplikacji** internetowych i tworzenie aplikacji internetowych. Przejdź do strony [pobierania Visual Studio,](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) aby zainstalować ją bezpłatnie.
  Jeśli musisz zainstalować obciążenie i masz już zainstalowane Visual Studio, przejdź do tematu Narzędzia Pobierz narzędzia i   >  **funkcje...,** co spowoduje otwarcie Instalator programu Visual Studio. Wybierz obciążenie **tworzenie aplikacji ASP.NET sieci Web,** a następnie wybierz pozycję **Modyfikuj.**

1. Następnie kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy projekt Vue i wybierz menu **Właściwości,** a następnie przejdź do **sekcji Debugowanie.** Zmień debuger, aby uruchamiał się na **opcję launch.json.**
 
   :::image type=""content"" source=""media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-with-vue-choose-debugger.png"" alt-text=""Wybierz debuger (launch.json)"":::

## <a name=""set-the-startup-project""></a>Ustawianie projektu startowego

1. Kliknij rozwiązanie prawym przyciskiem myszy i wybierz pozycję **Ustaw Project.** Zmień projekt startowy z Pojedynczy projekt startowy na **Wiele projektów startowych.** Wybierz **pozycję** Uruchom dla akcji każdego projektu.
  
1. Następnie wybierz projekt zaplecza i przenieś go nad frontonie, aby najpierw się uruchomił.

   :::image type=""content"" source=""media/vs-2022/asp-net-core-with-vue-set-first-project.png"" alt-text=""Wybieranie pierwszego projektu startowego"":::

## <a name=""start-the-project""></a>Uruchamianie projektu

Naciśnij **klawisz F5** lub wybierz **przycisk Uruchom** w górnej części okna. Zostaną wyświetlone dwa monity:

- Uruchomiony ASP.NET Core API aplikacji
- Interfejs wiersza polecenia Vue z uruchomionym poleceniem vue-cli-service serve

Powinna pojawić się aplikacja Vue wypełniona za pośrednictwem interfejsu API.

## <a name=""troubleshooting""></a>Rozwiązywanie problemów

Może zostać wyświetlony następujący błąd:

```
[HPM] Error occurred while trying to proxy request /weatherforecast from localhost:4200 to https://localhost:5001 (ECONNREFUSED) (https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors)
```

Jeśli widzisz ten problem, najprawdopodobniej frontend został uruchomiony przed zaplecza. Po uruchomieniu wiersza polecenia zaplecza wystarczy odświeżyć aplikację Vue w przeglądarce.

"# Movietrailer
   Movie tariler application allows the user to disply his/her favourite movies in the webbrowser. The server side coding
   helps to do this in an easier way.Implemented using python shell python 2.7.11
## The mainclass > Movietrailer
  The base class movietrailer is created and can be reused for the different child classes.
  **import package webbrowser**  
  The favourite moives are going to be displayed in webbroswer.This package allows user to enter his/her favourite movielinks   into the code.The link is given below on how to use webbrowser packages.
  **https://docs.python.org/2/library/webbrowser.html**  
  
  **define __init(self,param)**  
  The init function will be the first function to be executed.The self refers to itself and Param may contain either 
  one to many or no parameter seperated by comma's.
  For example:
  define __init__(self,movietitle,movietrailer)  
  The movietitle and movie trailer parameters are passed to display the respective movietitle and movietrailer.
  
  **define requiredmethod()**  
  The user can define their own methods.This method can be accessed using calssname followed by method name.
  
  **Class name.Method_name**  
  For example:
  define show_trailer(self)
  This method action is defined by it's name. The show trailer implies when it is executed it will show the user favourite
  movie trailer.
  
## The subclass

  This class will import the functionalities defined at base class with additional features in case it is required.The other   packages/class can also be imported.
  This can be done by using ** ""import classname/package name""**   at beginning of the program.
  
  For example:
  import baseclass __This name is same as the name given to the base class program__
  **calling the function in base class**   
  
  The function defined inside the base class is called using the file name followed by the class name and it's parameters.
  
  **mainclass.method_name(parameters_seperated_by_commas)**  
  For example:
  The baseclass has the class name base and the method name as __init__ followed by the parameters movie_title,
  movie_storyline
  movietrailer.base(italian_job,""hijack"")
  
  **create list of movie name's**   
  The list is the collection of elements and enclosed within '[]'bracket's.
  The simple list is created as follows:
  
  **list_name=[list_of_elements]**    
  For example:
  In this project the movielist is created
  movies=[sun_rise,italian_job],the movie list is created.
  
  **Displaying the favourite movie using HTML file **  
  The movies will be stored in an array list and passed as parameter to the script file.
  The script files imports the required package to display the list in webbrowser.The movies are arranged in an order and 
  required style using the HTML.
    **http://www.w3schools.com/html/**   is the link to basics of HTML.
  For example:
  movies = [italian_job,ice age2] and scripting python file name as apple then,
  apple.open_movie(movies) __the open_movies is the method inside script file__

"# Filestore Setup

Filestore is a component that provides upload, management and download of medical and project files.

Edit the file `config/initializers/nfs_store_config.rb`

Ensure that the following components are installed:

- bindfs
- fuse
- unzip

If using a network filesystem mount, ensure it is mounted and appropriate bind mounts added, following this kind of pattern:

    FS_ROOT=/efs1
    FS_DIR=main
    MOUNT_ROOT=/mnt/fphsfs
    WEBAPP_USER=webapp
    mkdir -p /efs1
    getent group 599 || groupadd --gid 599 nfs_store_all_access
    getent group 600 || groupadd --gid 600 nfs_store_group_0
    getent group 601 || groupadd --gid 601 nfs_store_group_1
    getent passwd 600 || useradd --user-group --uid 600 nfsuser
    usermod -a --groups 599 $WEBAPP_USER
    mkdir -p $FS_ROOT
    mountpoint -q $FS_ROOT || mount -t efs -o tls fs-c302a188:/ $FS_ROOT
    mkdir -p $MOUNT_ROOT/gid600
    mkdir -p $MOUNT_ROOT/gid601
    mountpoint -q $MOUNT_ROOT/gid600 || bindfs --map=@600/@599 --create-for-group=600 --create-for-user=600 --chown-ignore --chmod-ignore --create-with-perms='u=rwD:g=rwD:o=' $FS_ROOT/$FS_DIR $MOUNT_ROOT/gid600
    mountpoint -q $MOUNT_ROOT/gid601 || bindfs --map=@601/@599 --create-for-group=601 --create-for-user=600 --chown-ignore --chmod-ignore --create-with-perms='u=rwD:g=rwD:o=' $FS_ROOT/$FS_DIR $MOUNT_ROOT/gid601

In production, consider creating a separate schema and moving the tables there, plus
updating the app search path.

## Adding App Types to Filestore

A script is provided in **app-scripts/setup_filestore_app.sh** (for dev)

The NfsStore expects a specific structure for new App Types.

    APP_TYPE_ID=11

    FS_ROOT=/efs-prod
    FS_DIR=main
    APPTYPE_DIR=app-type-${APP_TYPE_ID}

    cd $FS_ROOT/$FS_DIR
    mkdir -p $APPTYPE_DIR/containers
    chmod 770 $APPTYPE_DIR
    chmod 770 $APPTYPE_DIR/containers
    chown nfsuser:nfs_store_all_access $APPTYPE_DIR
    chown nfsuser:nfs_store_group_0 $APPTYPE_DIR/containers

**Note** the _nfs_store_all_access_ group owner can be changed to another owner, such as _nfs_store_group_0_ if access is to be controlled by the OS and user role _nfs_store group 600_

<a id=""init""></a>
## Initialization
```cpp
ovs<gain> ovs;
// gain -The cranberry in <> indicates how many bits to increase the resolution. From 1 to 6 (inclusive)
```

<a id=""usage""></a>
## Usage
```cpp
uint32_t read(uint8_t pin); // read from analog pin and convert
uint32_t get(); // get value (updated after read() and compute())
uint32_t getMax(uint16_t bits); // get maximum value at initial resolution
uint16_t samples(); // get the number of measurements to take

void reset(); // reset calculation
void add(uint16_tval); // add dimension
void compute(); // convert
```
The library can be used both to work with the onboard ADC and to process data from other sources.

### Onboard ADC
It is enough to call `read(analogue pin)`, which will return the converted result.
It is also possible to get the previous converted value from `get()`.

### Manual mode
In this mode, you can feed values ​​to the library from other sources:
- Before a new measurement, you need to call `reset()`
- Next, you need to pass new values ​​to `add(val)` in an amount equal to `samples()`
- After passing the required number of values, call `compute()`
- Get the converted value from `get()`

### How does it work
Oversampling actually averages **N** measurements (in the library, this number can be obtained from `samples()`),
fitting the new range to the specified **Gain** resolution increase. Required number of measurements
depends on the gain as `N = 2^(2*Gain)`, i.e. 4096 measurements are needed to increase the resolution by 6 bits!

Gain|N |
----|-------|
+1 |4 |
+2 |16 |
+3 |64 |
+4 |256 |
+5 |1024 |
+6 |4096 |

<a id=""example""></a>
## Example
### Onboard ADC
```cpp
#include <OVS.h>

// increase bit depth by 2
// (AVR Arduino 10+2 = 12 bits)
ovs<2> ovs;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read from analog pin and convert
  Serial print(ovs.cranberry read(0));
  Serial print(',');
  
  // after ovs.read() you can get the last result from ovs.get()

  // output max. value at initial resolution (We have 10 bit ADC)
  Serial.println(ovs.getMax(10));
}
```

### Manual mode
```cpp
// oversampling, manual mode
#include <OVS.h>

// increase bit depth by 2
// (AVR Arduino 10+2 = 12 bits)
ovs<2> ovs;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // reset before measurement
  ovs reset();

  // add new values ​​in the amount ovs.samples()
  for (int i = 0; i < ovs.samples(); i++) {
    ovs.add(analogRead(0));
  }

  // transform
  ovs.compute();

  // display the result
  Serial.print(ovs.get());
  Serial print(',');

  // output max. value at initial resolution (We have 10 bit ADC)
  Serial.println(ovs.getMax(10));
}

"# SharpYAJ - YetAnotherJSON Reader/Writer for C#

SharpYAJ (pronounced as 'Sharp-Jay') is a .NET Standard 2.0 compatible library to serialize and deserialize JSON strings.

There's the class `JavaScriptSerializer` in .NET which does exactly this task, but unfortunately it's not yet included in .NET Standard any therefore only available when using .NET Framework. There would be Newtonsofts JSON implementation, but that library is way too big if you just want to read or write small JSON files, or if you just want simple .NET types instead of wrappers for each JSON type.

So, until the `JavaScriptSerializer` is defined in .NET Standard, this library can be used alternatively.

## Reading
SharpYAJ deserializes objects the same way, `JavaScriptSerializer` does:
- Objects are represented as `Dictionary<string, object>`
- Arrays are represented as `IEnumerable<object>`
- Primitives are represented as their corresponding .NET type (int, double, string, bool, null (object))

```csharp
using SharpYAJ;

var myJSONString = ""[1, 3, 3, 7, \""is\"", true]"";

object deserialized = YAJReader.ReadJSON(myJSONString);
//deserialized: IEnumerable<object> { 1, 3, 3, 7, ""is"", true }
```

### Numbers
In JSON, numbers can be infinitely high. In SharpYAJ they are read as follows:

|Range|Read as|
|---|---|
| -2^31 to (2^31 - 1) | int32 |
| -2^63 to (2^63 - 1) | int64/long |
| 2^63 to (2^64 - 1) | uint64/ulong |
| Everything else | double |

### Trailing commas
JSON doesn't allow trailing commas in arrays or objects like JavaScript does (e. g. `[1, 2, 3,]`), therefore SharpYAJ also doesn't allow it by default.
However if you want to parse such ""invalid"" JSON, you can enable that feature by compiling with flags `ALLOW_TRAILING_ARRAY_COMMAS` and `ALLOW_TRAILING_OBJECT_COMMAS`.

A list of all supported flags is at the end of this README.

### Comments
JSON doesn't allow comments like programming languages do (e. g. `[1, 2, /* 3, */ 4]`), therefore SharpYAJ also doesn't allow it by default.
However if you want to parse such ""invalid"" JSON, you can enable that feature by compiling with flags `ALLOW_LINE_COMMENTS` for `//`-comments and `ALLOW_BLOCK_COMMENTS` for `/* */`-comments.

A list of all supported flags is at the end of this README.

### Using internal methods
Beside `ReadJSON`, YAJReader contains methods like `ReadArray`, `ReadInt`, `ReadBool` and so on. These methods are used internally. If you want to use these methods for whatever reason, you have to tell SharpYAJ to perform additional checks in these methods, as by default they omit checks done by the SharpYAJ-caller method. To annouce the usage of these methods, compile the library with the `SHARE_INTERNAL_METHODS` flag.

To be more performant, the reading is done by simply moving a cursor over the string, so that a new substring does not have to be created for each element. This string-shifting is done by the internal class `StringView`. This class is also only shown if you activate compiliation flag `SHARE_INTERNAL_METHODS`. So for using the internal methods, you have to create a `StringView` instance.

## Writing
For writing objects SharpYAJ expects basically the same object types like it produced when reading a string:
- Objects have to be `IDictionary<string, object>`
- Arrays have to be `IEnumerable`
- Allowed primitive types are
  - `short`
  - `int`
  - `long`
  - `float`
  - `double`
  - `string`
  - `bool`
  - `null`

```csharp
using SharpYAJ;

var serialized = YAJWriter.WriteJSON(deserialized);
//serialized: ""[1,3,3,7,\""is\"",true]""
```

### Indention / PrettyPrint
By default, YAJWriter doesn't print any spaces or line-breaks to separate the elements.
If you want a pretty-printed JSON string, pass the `indention` flag to `WriteJSON`:

```csharp
using SharpYAJ;

var serialized = YAJWriter.WriteJSON(deserialized, true);
/*serialized:
""[
	1,
	3,
	3,
	7,
	\""is\"",
	true
]""
*/
```

To specify the separation and line-break char, they can also be passed to `WriteJSON`:
```csharp
using SharpYAJ;

var serialized = YAJWriter.WriteJSON(deserialized, ""~~~~"", ""\r\n"");
/*serialized:
""[
~~~~1,
~~~~3,
~~~~3,
~~~~7,
~~~~\""is\"",
~~~~true
]""
*/
```

#### Own pretty print implementation
Pretty printing is done using the internal class `IndentWriter`. If you want to implement pretty print yourself, create a subclass overriding the methods of `IndentWriter` and pass the instance to the `WriteJSON` method:
```csharp
using SharpYAJ;

class MyIndentWriter : IndentWriter
{
	public override void Write(StringBuilder sb)
	{
		/* ... */
	}
}

var myIndentWriter = new MyIndentWriter();

var serialized = YAJWriter.WriteJSON(deserialized, myIndentWriter);
```

## Compiler flags
Following compiler flags are supported by SharpYAJ:

|Flag|Description|
|---|---|
|USE_INTERNAL_METHODS|Makes some internal methods public and adds extra checks to them so they can be used safely|
|ALLOW_TRAILING_ARRAY_COMMAS|Allow a trailing comma after the last element of an array|
|ALLOW_TRAILING_OBJECT_COMMAS|Allow a trailing comma after the last entry of an object|
|ALLOW_LINE_COMMENTS|Allow line comments `//` to mark the rest of the current line (until the next `\n`) as comment|
|ALLOW_BLOCK_COMMENTS|Allow block comments `/* */` to mark a certain area as comment|

Hacash 挖矿规范、数据和服务接口文档
===

本文档包含 Hacash 挖矿相关的一系列数据和服务的运行方式和接口规范，用于开发第三方商业矿池、私人挖矿客户端或矿池统计服务等等与挖矿相关的业务。

1 体系结构
---

我们采用“中继节点（Relay Nodes）”方式提供挖矿相关的数据接口服务，示意如下：

中继节点不仅是连接若干个挖矿客户端的服务端，也是所有挖矿相关的数据接口的服务端。一个 Hacash 全节点下面可以挂载若干个中继节点（基于TCP连接，连接数量视服务器性能和带宽大小而定），中继节点还可以树状串联（即中继节点作为服务端，下方再连接挂载若干个个中继节点，且可以多层连接），由此可以在一个全节点下方挂载理论上无数台挖矿客户端机器。

挖矿客户端（矿工机器）除了可连接到中继节点，有需要时也可以直接连接到全节点。中继服务节点除了提供实时的挖矿相关的状态和数据、计算生成挖矿所需的数据准备材料，也可以统计和保存下连矿工的算力数据，并且提供算力统计数据的查询接口，为更上层的矿池整体算力计算和奖励分配计算提供统计数据。

2 部署运行
---

请在 [software_release_log.md](https://github.com/hacash/miner/blob/master/doc/software_release_log.md) 地址中下载全节点软件、中继服务节点软件和矿工客户端软件，分别按照一下配置运行

第一步：首先需要运行一台 Hacash 的全节点，相关配置文件 `hacash.config.ini` 如下：

```ini
data_dir = ./hacash_mainnet_data

[p2p]
listen_port = 3337
boot_nodes = 1172.16.17.32:3337,172.16.31.10:3337

[miner]
enable = true
rewards = 1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS

[minerserver]
enable = true
listen_port = 3350
```

以上配置中， `[miner]` 必须开启，表示全节点开启挖矿相关功能。而 `[minerserver]` 部分也必须同时开启，表示开启挖矿服务端服务，且服务监听 TCP 端口为 `3350` ，中继节点需要连接到此端口以同步最新区块信息。

命令行运行示例如下：

```shell script
./hacash_node_2021_05_15_01 hacash.config.ini
```

第二步：运行中继节点并连接到全节点，相关配置文件 `hacash_relay_service.config.ini` 如下：

```ini
server_connect = 127.0.0.1:3350
server_listen_port = 19991

http_api_listen_port = 8080

accept_hashrate = true
report_hashrate = true

[store]
enable = true
data_dir = ./hacash_relay_service_data
save_mining_block_stuff = true
save_mining_hash = true
save_mining_nonce = true
```

以上配置，其中 `server_connect` 表示要连接到的全节点或上级中继节点。 `server_listen_port` 表示本中继服务监听的端口，以供下级中继节点连接。 `http_api_listen_port` 表示 http 的 api 服务监听的端口。 `accept_hashrate` 表示是否接受下级中继节点上报的算力统计数据， `report_hashrate` 表示是否向上级中继节点或全节点提交算力统计信息。

`[store]` 配置部分则与保存算力统计和挖矿日志相关。

命令行运行示例如下：

```shell script
./hacash_miner_relay_service_2021_05_12_01 hacash_relay_service.config.ini
```

正常情况下可以看到输出：

```
Load ini config file: ""./hacash_relay_service.config.ini"" at time:07/15 17:17:27
[Miner Relay Service] Start server and listen on port 19991.
[Miner Relay Service] Http api listen on port: 8080
connecting server <127.0.0.1:3350>... success.
note: pool is not accept PoW power statistics.
receive new block <257282> mining stuff forward to [0] clients at time 07/15 17:17:28.

```

服务正确运行之后，我们访问 `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` 将看待如下信息

```js
{
  ret: 0,
  service: ""hacash miner relay service""
}
```

表示 HTTP 接口服务正常运行中。

第三步：运行挖矿客户端，相关配置文件 `minerworker.config.ini` 如下：

```ini
pool = 127.0.0.1:19991

rewards = 1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS

supervene = 1 
```

配置里 `pool` 为要连接到的中继节点或全节点的地址。`rewards` 为收取挖矿奖励的统计地址。 `supervene` 为挖矿的并发数量，设置值与 CPU 核心数量有关。

命令行运行示例如下：

```shell script
./hacash_miner_worker_2021_05_24_01 minerworker.config.ini
```

运行后挖矿客户端就会连接到中继服务节点 `127.0.0.1:19991` 上开始挖矿，正常情况下将输出一下信息：

```
[Start] connect: 127.0.0.1:19991, reward: 1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS. 
startup CPU device of [1] supervene.
connecting miner server...connected successfully.
do mining height:‹259297›, difficulty: 00000000054e5b1...
```

表示成功连接，正在挖矿



3 HTTP 接口服务
---

#### 3.1 [GET] /query?action=pending_block 获取当前正在挖矿的区块信息

示例接口访问： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/query?action=pending_block&only_height=0&unitmei=0`

可选参数：

- [only_height] `bool` 是否只返回区块高度，用于判断最新挖掘的区块高度是否发生变化
- [unitmei] `bool` 是否按浮点数单位`枚`的形式返回 HAC 的数量

返回值示例：

```js
{
    block: {
        height: 257301
    },
    ret: 0
}

// 或者

{
    block: {
        difficulty: 3670274902,
        height: 257301,
        prevhash: ""00000000006cddd0c5837d077509714aa8070588599ce35ad41188c14a911ec9"",
        timestamp: 1626342425,
        transaction_count: 1,
        version: 1,
        witness_stage: 0
    },
    coinbase: {
        address: ""1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS"",
        body_version: 1,
        message: """",
        message_hex: ""20202020202020202020202020202020"",
        reward: ""ㄜ2:248"",
        witness_count: 0,
        witness_sigs: [ ],
        witnesses: [ ]
    },
    mrkl_miner_related_hash_list: [ ],
    ret: 0
}
```

本接口将返回所有与挖矿相关的区块信息（不包含交易列表），理论上第三方开发者可以按照区块数据格式“拼装”成区块头数据，并根据默克尔相关hash（即 `mrkl_miner_related_hash_list` 参数）得出待挖矿基础数据。但这需要深度理解 Hacash 的区块数格式细节，对于第三方开发者来说过于复杂。所以我们接下来提供另一个十分简捷的接口来获得待挖矿基础数据。

#### 3.2 [GET] /query?action=mining_stuff 获取挖矿模块数据

示例接口访问： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/query?action=mining_stuff`

返回值示例：

```js
{
    ret: 0,
    height: 257301,
    target_difficulty_hash: ""00000000061f9ab0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"",
    coinbase_nonce: ""6d4519e65ec75d191d741343d3a46fcf8f75081aacddd01d2be25f0febb9d760"",
    stuff: ""01000003ed150060f0041900000000006cddd0c5837d077509714aa8070588599ce35ad41188c14a911ec9dbe4be5a0ce2729659e5dbba7d6dea54a9e4b62dffd811a1cfad66ae33eac0390000000100000000dac3f3560000"",
    head_nonce_start: 79,
    head_nonce_len: 4
}
```

本接口以最简捷且向后兼容的格式返回待挖矿的基础数据，第三方无需理解区块格式的细节。具体返回值说明如下：

- [height] `int` 待挖矿的区块高度
- [target_difficulty_hash] 难度目标哈希值，用于判断挖矿是否成功
- [coinbase_nonce] `hex string` 以 HEX 格式返回的随机 nonce 值，此值每次访问接口时都会随机产生，为固定长度32位hash，每次都不同。此值需要临时保存在挖矿客户端，以便向服务器报告挖矿结果时附带回传，具体用途将在下文解释
- [stuff] `hex string` 以 HEX 格式返回的区块挖矿基础数据，用于做 `x16rs` 算法挖矿的输入数据
- [head_nonce_start] `int` 区块头 nonce 值在基础挖矿数据（即 stuff 返回值）内的起始位置
- [head_nonce_len] `int` 区块头 nonce 值的长度

与其它基于 PoW 挖矿的项目一样，Hacash 也通过不断的重复尝试某种哈希运算（不断地改变输入值），直到寻找到符合难度目标的哈希。 Hacash 的区块挖掘哈希函数采用原创的 `X16RS` 算法，要了解这种算法的细节请参见源代码 [https://github.com/hacash/x16rs/blob/master/x16rs.go#L72](https://github.com/hacash/x16rs/blob/master/x16rs.go#L72) 中的两个相关函数：

```go
func HashX16RS(loopnum int, data []byte) []byte {
    // ...
}

func CalculateBlockHash(blockHeight uint64, stuff []byte) []byte {
    // ...
}
```

其中 `CalculateBlockHash(uint64, []byte)` 函数的两个参数即分别是上文接口返回的 `height` 与 `stuff` 的值，此函数返回一个 32 位的哈希结果，即区块哈希，用于判断挖矿是否成功。但如果每次都传递相同的 height 与 stuff 值，则 CalculateBlockHash 函数返回的哈希结果不变。

挖矿的过程即每次都尝试不同的 `stuff` 值作为 `CalculateBlockHash` 函数的参数，多次执行运算得出不同的结果，并判断哈希结果是否满足难度要求（即 target_difficulty_hash 返回值，比此目标难度哈希定义的更“小”的哈希 ）的过程。

但 `stuff` 的值并不是完全随机的，它包含了区块头的结构化数据，所以不能随机任意传递 `stuff` 的值，而必须在上文接口中 `stuff` 返回数据的基础上按规则修改，才能得到合法的 `stuff` 值。合法的修改需要借助于 `head_nonce_start` 以及 `head_nonce_len` 两个参数，也就是说，只有这两个值定义的 stuff 数据的指定部分才是可以随机修改的，我们称作为 `head_nonce`，而其它部分不能修改，否则导致区块数据被破坏，挖矿将无效。由于必须考虑到区块格式版本升级等向后兼容的问题，所以 `stuff` 值中可以被随机替换的部分也可能在将来被升级改动，所以 `head_nonce_start` 和 `head_nonce_len` 的值并不是固定不变的，这也就意味着 `stuff` 能够被合法随机替换的部分，包括位置和长度，也是可能变动的。

例如上文接口返回的 `stuff` 值是一个长度为 89 的 buffer ， `head_nonce_start` 返回 79 且 `head_nonce_len` 返回 4 则表示 stuff 数据 buffer 数组索引（下标从 0 开始） 79 位开始的后 4 位值是可以随机替换的 `head_nonce` 值，具体为下面数据中被括号括起来的数据（即 00000001 四位字节）是可以被随机替换的部分。

01000003ed380060f035f000000000011c057cabe71255adb713ffda047e429e602054154416432299e3b089ba5abbbbc8eca9c38d5bcdada7fdf8c81027b61ddfd11adb27be19520ecf63(`00000001`)00000000dac3f3560000

总共四位可被随机替换，则共有 `255^4 = 4228250625` 约 42 亿次哈希运算尝试的机会。如果 42 亿个 `head_nonce` 被全部尝试完毕却仍然没有找到复合目标难度的哈希结果，则需要再次调用本接口（即 /query?action=pending_block ）以获得一个新的 `stuff` 值及一个新的 32 位的 `coinbase_nonce` 值。也就是说，Hacash 区块内部其实有两个可以随机尝试替换的 nonce 值： `coinbase_nonce` 和 `head_nonce`。而一旦 `coinbase_nonce` 值改变，则 `head_nonce` 又将获得一个新的 42 次尝试机会。只不过，为了封装技术细节，保持第三方挖矿的简洁性，从 `coinbase_nonce` 值结合区块头数据生成有效 `stuff` 这一过程被隐藏了，由接口每次被调用时自动化随机生成 `coinbase_nonce` 供大家直接使用。

那么如何判断 `CalculateBlockHash` 挖矿函数的哈希结果是否满足难度目标（即挖矿成功）呢？我们来看另一个位于 [https://github.com/hacash/mint/blob/master/difficulty/check.go#L14](https://github.com/hacash/mint/blob/master/difficulty/check.go#L14) 的函数 `CheckHashDifficultySatisfy`：

```go
func CheckHashDifficultySatisfy(result_hash, target_diffculty_hash []byte) bool {
	if len(result_hash) != 32 || len(target_diffculty_hash) != 32 {
		panic(""CheckHashDifficultySatisfy hx1, hx2 size must be 32."")
	}
	for k := 0; k < 32; k++ {
		if result_hash[k] < target_diffculty_hash[k] {
			return true
		} else if result_hash[k] > target_diffculty_hash[k] {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
```

此函数很简单，即比较哈希计算尝试的结果 `result_hash` 与目标难度哈希值 `target_diffculty_hash` 的“大小”，当 结果哈希“小于”目标难度时（也就是表现为哈希值前导零的数量更多），则表示挖矿成功。


#### 3.3 [GET] /submit?action=mining_result 提交挖矿结果（挖矿成功或者算力统计）

示例接口访问： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/submit?action=mining_result&mint_success=0&reward_address=1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS&block_height=257370&head_nonce=f6f6f6f6&coinbase_nonce=6d4519e65ec75d191d741343d3a46fcf8f75081aacddd01d2be25f0febb9d760`

参数说明：

- [mint_success] `bool` 本地自己判断是否挖矿成功（远程服务端会再做一次判断）
- [reward_address] `string` 挖矿奖励统计的收益账户
- [block_height] `int` 本次挖矿的区块高度 
- [head_nonce] `hex string` 挖矿的随机数结果
- [coinbase_nonce] `hex string` 从接口获取并原样回传的 coinbase_nonce 值

返回结果：

```js
{
    ret: 0,
    stat: ""ok""
}
```

在上一个接口 `/query?action=mining_stuff` 内获取的 `coinbase_nonce` 值，需要在本接口原封不动的回传，服务端将用到此参数进行区块头数据的组装和哈希运算结果的验证。

当我们判断成功挖到一个区块时，则调用本接口，提交 `head_nonce` 及相关数据，中继节点会一层一层提交到全节点，并且验证后将成功挖到的区块广播到全网，其他所有矿工就会收到新的区块，自动开始挖掘下一个区块。

同样，当别人成功挖掘到区块时，新的区块通知将到达每一台矿机，所有矿工自动调用 `/query?action=mining_stuff` 接口获取下一个将被挖掘的区块数据，开始新一轮的挖掘。

但 HTTP 接口是无状态的协议，你可以通过定时轮询 `/query?action=pending_block&only_height=1` 判断是否有新区快到来，从而判断是否切换到下一个挖掘的区块上。 当然，如果你的采矿机器性能足够好，可以在几秒甚至一秒以内尝试完 42 亿次的 `head_nonce` 值空间，那就不需要轮询监听新区块了， `/query?action=mining_stuff` 接口会自动返回新待挖掘的区块数据。

#### 3.4 [GET] /uery?action=mining_result 查询算力统计

可以通过 idx_start 和 idx_limit 组成的全局自增序号（类似数据库的自增主键）来查询全部算力统计的日志。only_worth 参数标记是否忽略其他统计信息，仅仅返回 result_hash_worth 即算力哈希率统计值。 result_hash_worth 是矿池按照算力大小决定分配奖励的比例的主要指标。

示例接口访问1： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/query?action=mining_result&idx_start=1&idx_limit=10&only_worth=0`

返回值示例1：

```js
{
    list: [
    {
        block_height: 259297,
        coinbase_nonce: ""e5fd87815870054a7c4f210fa7f8ed80fd4f6793ecfdacbbcf26dbcff4bafad1"",
        head_nonce: ""57f03300"",
        mint_success: 0,
        result_hash: ""00000001218476129eaaf2e665ac11195026786bfd3f68630ae3c654042ef62c"",
        result_hash_worth: ""4275993344"", // 算力哈希率
        reward_address: ""1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS""
    },
    {
        block_height: 259298,
        coinbase_nonce: ""4cbc0c77bbf17b992285a9dcabbf199dbd7219106254fa72f8960a1341f7b3d4"",
        head_nonce: ""99190d00"",
        mint_success: 0,
        result_hash: ""0000031336414d6b1db663c289f061d68c0e491b6c01fe9b30ccd16dc2c4d204"",
        result_hash_worth: ""16575689"",
        reward_address: ""1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS""
    },
    ...
    ]
}
```

除了按日志序号查询算力统计，也可以通过区块高度和奖励地址查询更加精确仔细的统计数据。

示例接口访问2： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/query?action=mining_result&reward_address=1AVRuFXNFi3rdMrPH4hdqSgFrEBnWisWaS&block_height_start=259297&block_height_limit=10&only_worth=1`

返回值示例2：

```js
{
    list: [
    {
        block_height: 259297,
        result_hash_worth: ""4275993344"" // 如果传递 only_worth 参数则只返回算力值统计
    },
    {
        block_height: 259298,
        result_hash_worth: ""16575689""
    },
    ...
    ]
}
```

本接口用来查询挖矿客户端上报的挖矿结果日志和算力统计记录，是自主开发第三方矿池的必备统计数据。当然，这并不是必须的，若具备相应的开发能力，了解 Hacash 底层的技术，第三方可以开发自己的算力统计服务。


#### 3.5 [GET] /uery?action=mining_result 查询算力统计

示例接口访问： `http://127.0.0.1:8080/query?action=historical_block&height=259298`

返回值示例：

```js
{
    block: {
        difficulty: 3668560738,
        height: 259298,
        prevhash: ""00000000011e293f92e9d93ea9ab2dce6a012fb1e8f467e9ab08511813fb162e"",
        timestamp: 1626945557,
        transaction_count: 1,
        version: 1,
        witness_stage: 0
    },
    coinbase: {
        address: ""1MzNY1oA3kfgYi75zquj3SRUPYztzXHzK9"",
        body_version: 1,
        message: ""unknown"",
        message_hex: ""756e6b6e6f776e202020202020202020"",
        reward: ""ㄜ2:248"",
        witness_count: 0,
        witness_sigs: [ ],
        witnesses: [ ]
    },
    mrkl_miner_related_hash_list: [ ],
    ret: 0
}
```

本接口是查询本中继节点历史挖矿的区块信息（无论是否成功挖出），用于可能的算力验证。",

  As someone coming from C and C++, javascript is a language that is quite interesting to use. You don’t have to worry about variable data types which makes it very easy to write up simple but working code. However, I can say that I don’t really enjoy the absence of data types as they were a decent way of ensuring the code would at least work. If you were completely new to programming however, it would be a very easy language to start off with as there is very little you actually need to know aside from how to actually code javascript. Also, the absence of data types seems to lend itself to the fact that the language as a whole can be written fairly quickly when compared to other languages. Without having to worry about types, you simply give inputs and outputs of variables and functions to variables and they are able to hold them.

<img class=""Learn java script"" src=""../images/keep-calm-and-learn-javascript.jpg"">

  The introductory WODs were helpful in learning the language, but overall it just comes down to being familiar enough with javascript, and that depends entirely on the amount of time you are willing to put in.  It is for this reason that the WODs are so helpful, they make sure you keep dealing with javascript on a day to day basis, rather than once in a blue moon. It is for this reason that I think I will enjoy “athletic software engineering” as the hardest part for me is putting in time every day, rather than having larger binge learning sessions. While I have a few thoughts on the language from my perspective, I’m not yet familiar enough with the language to give an accurate statement of whether or not it is a good language for software engineering. On one hand, it is easy to pick up and start with, but on the other, without types it seems like it is just waiting for something to go wrong. No matter what however, I am excited to learn more of the ins and outs of javascript and how to best apply my previous language knowledge to the problems Javascript will present.

"# A simple NATS logger
This is a simple demonstration using NATS to publish log messages in a distributed system.

## Overview
This demonstrates NATS though a simple logging utility that publishes log messages in a distributed environment.  NATS subscribers can register specific interest to filter what messages they receive.  The simple, scalable, lightweight nature of NATS makes this easy.

## Requirements
A running NATS server is required for this demonstration code.

```bash
go get github.com/nats-io/gnatsd
gnatsd
```

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/ColinSullivan1/nats-logger
```

## API Usage
The appname is set when you create the logger, the type is set by the API called.  Let's walk through an example.

```go
import (
    ""github.com/ColinSullivan1/nats-logger/natslog""
)
```

Now create a NATS logger and log some messages.
```go
# Create a NATS logger for ""myapp""
l, _ := natslog.NewNATSLogger(""myapp"", ""nats://localhost:4222"")

l.Infof(""Here is an info message."")
# This message will be published to logging.myapp.inf

l.Errorf(""Here is an error message."")
# This message will be published to logging.myapp.err
```

## Subject namespace
This uses the following subject namespace.  For more on NATS subjects, see the [NATS Protocol ](http://nats.io/documentation/internals/nats-protocol/)

`logging.<appname>.<type>`
Any applications that are listening can receive messages on:

`logging.myapp.err` and `logging.myapp.inf`

Here is the advantage of using the NATS subject namespace here - subscribing to certain subjects using wildcards will allow you to filter data.

To receive all log messages from every app, subscribe to:
`logging.>`

To receive all log messages from just `myapp`, subscribe to:
`logging.myapp.*`

To receive only error messages from `myapp`, subscribe to:
`logging.myapp.err`

To receive only error messages from all applications:
`logging.*.err`

...and so forth.


## Running the demo application from the command line
```bash
Usage of demo-app:
  -app string
    	Application name (default ""demoapp"")
  -url string
    	URL of the nats server (default ""nats://localhost:4222"")
```

### Run the demo app
```bash
cd demo-app
go build
./demo-app -app myapp1 2>app1.out &
./demo-app -app myapp2 2>app2.out &
```

### Run nats-sub
Use the nats-sub example to receive and print messages being generated 
by the demo apps.

```bash
go get github.com/nats-io/go-nats
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nats-io/go-nats/examples
go run nats-sub.go ""logging.>""
```

Example output:
```

# C28109
warning C28109: Variable cannot be held at the time function is called  
  
 The program is holding a resource that should not be held when it is calling this function. Typically, it indicates that the resource was unintentionally acquired twice. The Code Analysis tool reports this warning when resources are acquired and released in the same function.  
  
## Example  
 The following code example generates this warning:  
  
```  
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource, true);  
...  
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource, true);  
```  
  
 The following code example avoids this warning:  
  
```  
ExAcquireResourceLite(resource, true);  
```",

# Can-you-feed-me

The ""Can you feed me?"" mobile app is a tool for decision makers and the general public to understand the self-sufficiency of their country across decades and under fluctuating market conditions. It was built to withstand global demand and supply data. When the app is fully connected to high resolution global croplands and pasture databases, it can zoom into local areas and find their strategic self-sufficient perimeter which a community would need to sustain should imports or exports fluctuate. 

This project is solving the Food Directions challenge.
Description
Overview: This app attempts to bring awareness to the simple question, can you be fed? The UN calculates that with the current global food store, everyone COULD be fed.

This is based on your location (country-level) and the amount of food actually available (not how it is dispersed). The possibility of being fed, Yes or No, is calculated on the potential food stores of the current trade and production, as well as if there are no imports.

GOAL: Bring awareness to large amount of food stores and the possibility of everyone being fed.

STAKEHOLDERS/USERS: The FAO, from which the data is taken from, is involved for the amount of data used.

I can help educators and general public gain awareness of food stores and food availability.

It can be used as input into disaster and wartime scenarios to help officials prepare mitigation plans and identify strategic food sustainability perimeters.

TRENDS AND INSIGHT: Show the large amount of food wasted and improper distribution.

IDEAS: Can you be fed? YES OR NOT?

CONCEPT: Basically, visualize the amount of food available and the types if potentially all food was shared, and what food would be available with or without trade (import/export).

Lever six heures trente ; départ sept heures quinze.
Marche tranquille, sur une route moyenne, montant doucement : rien à signaler.

Dans les champs, comme depuis dix jours, des petits oiseaux gris volettent à notre passage.
Ce sont des cochevis huppés.
Tapis dans les fétus ou les broussailles, leur plumage les dissimule parfaitement.

En milieu de matinée, nous finissons le territoire bâtard, mi-plaine mi-montagne, traversé un peu au radar, comme enfermés sur nous-mêmes.
Il ne fut pas vide : nous y avons vu et vécu cent petites choses, comme il y a à voir et à vivre partout et toujours.
Mais il est l’un de ces espaces intermédiaires, pour le marcheur, qui file vite, ne colle pas aux souvenirs, ni n’arrive à s’écrire.
Qui est frustrant, aussi.
Car aussitôt tu le quittes, aussitôt tu comprends avoir loupé quelque chose.

À sa toute fin, juste avant le douar Imlil, nous grimpons sur une bonne butte, pour y visiter -- pur hasard -- une vieille kasbah.
D’ici, nous contemplons à loisir les parents du rejeton bâtard.

Devant, sur tout le quart nord-ouest, une immense plaine -- pour moitié vert-culture, pour moitié jaune-désert -- écrase l’œil de son absolue platitude, tout juste arrêtée, dans sa course vers l’infini, par quelques modestes reliefs.
N’est-ce pas là Marrakech, à cent kilomètres à l’ouest, lourde de son million d’habitants ?
À cette ville impériale, nous n’irons pas plus près.

Derrière, sur tout l’horizon sud, des chaînes de hautes montagnes se succèdent, sublimes et racoleuses, dont certaines, coquettes, ont paré leurs sommets de blanches neiges.

Notre promontoire est parfait pour appréhender le violent contraste des paysages, la transition et le mélange des territoires et des couleurs.
Et bonus, nous pouvons caresser de jolies ruines d’histoire.

Encore cinq kilomètres, puis nous arrivons à Demnate, par ses bas quartiers, ses mécanos et ses vendeurs en gros, jusqu’à arriver à la gare routière, à la station des taxis, puis au centre-ville, en passant sous son imposante *bab*.

La ville est moyenne -- vingt-cinq mille habitants -- et mignonnette.
Au pied des montagnes, elle serait parfaite pour se reposer, avant d’entamer la traversée des hauteurs.
Voici huit jours que nous avons quitté Khouribga.
Depuis, peu de repos.
Nous avons le corps et l’esprit qui protestent, un peu, de trop marcher.
Là, nous pourrions manger à satiété, faire la grasse mat’, voir bouillonner les gens d’ici et vivre la ville.
Et, dans un cyber, prendre les nouvelles du monde et en donner.

Mais, aspirés par le massif, hypnotisés par ses sommets, un truc en nous réclame de partir au plus vite, gagner enfin ce Haut Atlas.
Ça sera, pour Mathieu comme pour moi, une première expérience en solitaire dans la haute montagne, en hiver qui plus est, et dans un pays étranger.

Nos corps excités ne peuvent plus attendre.
Alors, après un gras poulet-frites, deux heures au cyber et un ravitaillement pour deux jours, nous partons par le haut de la ville et traçons la route.

Le soleil se couche dans la montagne, la chaleur avec.
Qu’il est agréable alors de vagabonder, au rythme des zigs et des zags, même si des camions bondés nous frôlent, avec leur trentaine de passagers, certains en équilibre sur le toit, d’autres accrochés d’une seule main à l’échelle arrière.
Nous nous saluons mutuellement, réciproquement étonnés : eux, de nous voir marcher là ; nous, de leurs périlleuses positions.

Le soleil continue sa descente.
Il devient urgent de trouver un lieu où dormir.

Nous arrivons finalement à Imi n’ifri, sept kilomètres après Demnate.
C’est une superbe arche, creusée dans la roche par un petit oued, depuis des millions d’années.
À l’intérieur, au plafond : d’énormes stalactites, des centaines de chauve-souris et d’oiseaux.
C’est impressionnant et gigantesque.

<marker=1>

Alors, nous descendons sous l’arche, sautant d’une pierre à l’autre, glissant un peu, longeant laborieusement l’oued, à la recherche du bon bivouac.
Vite vite ! Le soleil déjà est couché.

Au crépuscule, enfin, nous trouvons la place parfaite : un champ herbeux, solitaire, voisin d’un canal d’irrigation, pratique pour nos ablutions et celles de nos chaussettes.

L’été, les week-ends, les vacances, ce lieu est absolument congestionné.
Les Marocains y viennent en famille : pique-niquer, se détendre, se baigner, prendre le frais, etc.

# 矩阵

## 置换矩阵

置换矩阵是指每一行每一列恰好有一个$1$，其余元素是$0$的方阵。对于大小为$n\times n$的置换矩阵，很显然总共有$n!$种不同的置换矩阵。

置换矩阵的性质：
- 两个置换矩阵的乘积也是置换矩阵
- 如果$A$是置换矩阵，则$A^T=A^{-1}$。

第二点的证明可以观察行交换矩阵$P_{ij}$，可以发现$P_{ij}P_{ij}^T=I$，而所有矩阵都可以表示为行交换矩阵的乘积。

## LU分解

每个$R^{n\times n}$矩阵$A$都可以通过高斯消元，转换为置换矩阵，下三角矩阵和上三角矩阵的乘积。

$$
A=PLU
$$

进一步可以得到

$$
A=PLDU
$$

其中$P$是置换矩阵，$L$是单位下三角矩阵，$U$是单位上三角矩阵，且$L$与$U$的对角线元素均为$1$，$D$是对角线矩阵。

有些矩阵可以分解为$P=LU$的形式，其中$L$是下三角矩阵，$U$是上三角矩阵。一个可逆矩阵$A$可以进行LU分解当且仅当$A$的所有子式都非$0$。且如果存在LU分解，则矩阵$A$的$LDU$分解是唯一的。

## 矩阵乘法

矩阵乘法满足下面性质：

- 如果$A$和$B$均为上（下）三角矩阵，则$AB$也是上（下）三角矩阵

## 转置矩阵

矩阵$A$的转置记作$A^T$。转置矩阵拥有如下性质：

- $(A^T)^{-1}=(A^{-1})^T$
- $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$

## 对称矩阵

如果$A^T=A$，则称$A$是对称矩阵。

对称矩阵有下面性质：

- 对称矩阵只有实数特征值
- 我们可以为对称矩阵选择正交的特征向量

## 正交矩阵

如果一个$R^{n\times n}$矩阵$A$的列（行）向量为单位向量，且不同列（行）向量相互正交，那么矩阵$A$称为正交矩阵。

很显然置换矩阵也是正交矩阵。

正交矩阵$A$有下面性质：

- $A^{-1}=A^T$
- $\det(A)=\pm 1$

如果已知$A$的列向量标准正交，那么$A$的行向量也一定标准正交。因为$A^TA=I$，因此$AA^T=I$。

## 矩阵求逆

一个$n\times n$矩阵$A$有逆矩阵$A^{-1}$，等价于下面条件：

- $A$的行列式值非0
- $A$的行向量线性无关
- $A$的列向量线性无关
- $Ax=0$当且仅当$x=0$

一些推广：

- 如果$A$是上（下）三角矩阵，则$A$可逆当且仅当对角线元素中不含$0$。
- 如果$A$中对于任意$i$均满足$\sum_{j\neq i}^n\|a_{ij}\|<\|a_{ii}\|$，则$A$一定可逆

第二条性质的证明如下，设任意向量$x$满足$Ax=0$，设$x$中绝对值最大的成分为$x_i$，那么$A_ix$一定与$a_{ii}x_i$同号（即非$0$）。因此等式的唯一解为$x=0$，故可以推出$A$可逆。

矩阵$A$的逆矩阵有如下性质：

- 如果$A$是对称矩阵，则$A^{-1}$也是对称矩阵
- 如果$A$是上（下）三角矩阵，则$A^{-1}$也是上（下）三角矩阵
- 如果$A$是稀疏矩阵，则$A^{-1}$可能是密集矩阵
- $A^{-1}$是唯一的

# 投影

对于列向量$a$以及点$b$，$b$在$a$上的投影为$p=a\frac{a^Tb}{a^Ta}$，也可以写作$p=Pb$，其中$P=\frac{aa^T}{a^Ta}$。

对于$R^m$的子空间$S$，设其基为$n$个列向量（线性无关），由这$n$个列向量可以组成一个$m\times n$的矩阵$A$。子空间$S$的投影矩阵为$P=A(A^TA)^{-1}A^T$。

对于任意投影矩阵$P$，都满足：

- $P$是对称矩阵
- $P^2=P$
- $I-P$是$P$的正交补空间，$(I-P)P=0$，可以通过$(I-P)b=b-Pb=e$得到误差向量。
- $Py$是$P$的列空间中与$y$的$L^2$范数距离最小的向量。

# 特征值

对于方阵$A$，如果存在一个非零向量$x$，满足$Ax=\lambda x$，则称$x$是$A$的特征向量，且$\lambda$称为特征值（注意$\lambda$允许为$0$）。

可以发现$(A-\lambda I) x=0$，因此$x$位于$A-\lambda I$的零空间中，因此$A-\lambda I$一定是奇异矩阵。可以得到$\|A-\lambda I\|=0$。

$R^{n\times n}$上的方阵$A$的特征值$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$满足下面性质：

1. 如果$A$是个上（下）三角矩阵，则对角线上的所有元素正好是$A$的全部特征值。
2. 特征值不一定是实数，可能是复数。
3. $A$一定有$n$个复数特征值，但是可能有重复。
4. $\prod_{i=1}^n\lambda_i=\|A\|$
5. $\sum_{i=1}^n\lambda_i=\sum_{i=1}^nA_{i,i}$
6. 如果$A$的$n$个特征值各不相同，那么对应的$n$个特征向量则线性无关。

第$6$个性质的证明是这样的，设$n$个特征向量线性相关，则有$c_1x_1+\ldots+c_nx_n=0$，继而进行推导：

$$
A(c_1x_1+\ldots+c_nx_n)=\lambda_n(c_1x_1+\ldots+c_nx_n)\\
\Rightarrow (\lambda_1-\lambda_n)c_1x_1+\ldots+(\lambda_{n-1}-\lambda_n)c_{n-1}x_{n-1}=0
$$

接下来通过归纳法就可以证明$c_1=0$，从而证明$c_1=\ldots=c_n=0$。因此$n$个特征向量线性无关。

如果$n\times n$的方阵$A$有$n$个线性无关的特征向量$x_1,\ldots,x_n$，以及对应的$n$个特征值$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$，那么我们称$A$是可对角化的。记特征向量矩阵$X$的第$i$列向量为$x_i$，特征值矩阵$\Lambda$为对角线为$\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n$的矩阵，可以发现：

$$
AX=X\Lambda\Rightarrow X^{-1}AX=\Lambda\\
\Rightarrow A=X\Lambda X^{-1}
$$

可以发现$A^k=(X\Lambda X^{-1})^k=X\Lambda^kX^{-1}$，即$A^k$与$A$拥有相同的特征向量，但是对应的特征值为$\lambda_1^k,\ldots, \lambda_n^k$。

利用特征值可以实现矩阵快速幂。对于矩阵$A^kc$，若$c$处在$A$的特征向量组成的向量空间中，那么$c=a_1x_1+\ldots+a_mx_m$，这时候我们可以发现有$A^kc=a_1\lambda_1^kx_1+\ldots+a_m\lambda_m^kx_m$。

## 特征值分解

给定一个矩阵$A$，对于一个非$0$向量$v$，如果$Av=\lambda v$，则称$v$是$A$的特征向量，而$\lambda$是$A$的特征值。由于对于$A$的特征向量$v$，对于任意非$0$实数$\alpha$，$\alpha v$也是$A$的特征向量，且$\alpha x$和$x$的特征值相同，即缩放特征向量的时候特征值不变，因此我们一般仅考虑单位长度的特征向量。

如果一个$n\times n$矩阵$A$有$n$个线性无关的单位特征向量$V=(v_1,\ldots,v_n)$以及对应的特征值$\Lambda=(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_n)$，那么矩阵$A$的特征值可以表示为：

$$
AV=V\Lambda \Rightarrow A=V diag(\Lambda) V^{-1}
$$

特征值分解可以帮助我们观察一个矩阵的内在性质，就如同一个自然数可以分解为素数的幂的乘积形式，一旦得到这种形式，我们就能很快判断一个数有多少个因子等。

特别的，对于$n\times n$的对称实数矩阵$A$，它的$n$个特征值和特征向量都是实数。我们可以找到$n$个正交的标准特征向量构成一个标准正交矩阵$Q$，此时

$$
A=Q diag(\Lambda) Q^T
$$

## 正定矩阵

如果一个矩阵的所有特征值都是正数，则称其为正定矩阵，如果特征值非负，则称为半正定矩阵。对应的，如果所有特征值都是负数，则称为负定矩阵，如果特征值都非正，则成为半负定矩阵。

- 如果矩阵$A$是半正定矩阵，则$\forall x\in \mathbb{R}^n$，都有$xAx^T\geq 0$。
- 如果矩阵$A$是正定矩阵，则$\forall x\in \mathbb{R}^n$，都有$xAx^T\geq 0$，且$xAx^T=0\Rightarrow x=0$。

## 特征值和微积分

给定函数$\frac{d x(t)}{d t}=Ax$。记$A$的特征值和对应的特征向量为$\lambda_1,v_1,\ldots,\lambda_k,v_k$，那么$f(x)$的积分的通解如下：

$$
\int \frac{d x(t)}{d t}dt=\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\lambda_it}v_i
$$

如果给定$x(0)$，我们就可以得到具体的解，做法就是代入通解中，求出$c_1,\ldots,c_k$。

随着$t$趋向无穷，如果$\lambda_i$的实数部分为负数，那么$e^{\lambda_it}$会趋向与$0$，如果$\lambda_i$的实数部分为$0$，则$e^{\lambda_it}$会趋向与$1$，而如果$\lambda_i$为正数，则$e^{\lambda_it}$会趋向于无穷。

如果$A$有$n$个线性无关的特征向量，我们记其为$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_n$。以它们作为列向量组成的矩阵为$S$。我们简单记$x=Sy$，那么有：

$$
S\cdot \frac{dy}{dt}=ASy\\
\Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dt}=S^{-1}ASy\\
\Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dt}=\Lambda y\\
\Rightarrow y(t)=e^{\Lambda t}y(0)
$$

代回到原来的公式可以得到：

$$
x(t)=Sy(t)=Se^{\Lambda t}S^{-1}x(0)=e^{At}x(0)
$$

其中

$$
e^{At}=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{A^i}{i!}t^i
$$

# 相似矩阵

如果对于$R^{n\times n}$上的矩阵$A$和$B$，存在某个可逆矩阵$C$，满足$A=CBC^{-1}$，那么称$A$与$B$相似。很显然相似关系满足自反性，传递性，对称性，一次相似关系是一类等价关系。

很显然一个矩阵$A$如果有$n$个不同的特征值，则$A$一定与其特征值矩阵$\Lambda$相似。

如果$A$与$B$相似，则满足：

1. $A$与$B$拥有共同的特征值。（特征向量可能不同）

第一个性质的证明如下，设$Bx=\lambda x$，则有

$$
A(Cx)=CBC^{-1}(Cx)=CBx=\lambda (Cx)
$$

# 范数

我们一般用范数(norm)来描述一个向量的大小。$L^P$范数定义如下

$$
\left\|x\right\|_p=(\sum_{i}|x_i|^p)^{\frac{1}{p}}
$$

直观上来看，范数是将向量映射到非负实数的函数，函数值描述这个向量与原点的距离。范数拥有下面的性质：

- $f(x)=0\Leftrightarrow x=0$
- $f(x+y)\leq f(x)+f(y)$
- $\forall \alpha \in \mathbb{R},\alpha f(x)=f(\alpha x)$

一般$L^2$范数也称为欧几里得范数。由于欧几里得范数使用广泛，因此用$\left\|x\right\|$表示$x$的$L^2$范数，同时我们也可用$x^Tx$直接计算向量$x$的$L^2$范数的平方。$L^2$范数的平方非常适合计算，因为其偏导数$\frac{\partial \left\|x\right\|}{\partial x_i}=2x_i$仅需要依赖$x_i$，而$L^2$范数的偏导数需要计算涉及整个向量$x$。

但是$L^2$范数的平方在向量接近原点的时候增长非常缓慢，如果你的程序需要区分$0$和非常小的数值，那么可以选择使用$L^1$范数。

范数的特殊用法：

- $\left\|x\right\|_{\infty}=\max_i \left\|x_i\right\|$

我们可以把范数推广到矩阵上，只需要把$n\times m$的矩阵视作一个长度为$nm$的向量即可。作用在矩阵上的$L^2$也称作弗罗贝尼乌斯(Frobenius)范数，写作

$$
\left\|A\right\|_F=\sqrt{\sum_{1\leq i\leq n, 1\leq j\leq m}A_{i,j}^2}
$$

点积和$L^2$范数的关联：$x^Ty=\left\|x\right\|_2\left\|y\right\|_2\cos \theta$，其中$\theta$是$x$和$y$之间的夹角。

# 迹

矩阵的迹是指矩阵对角线元素的和。

$$
Tr(A)=\sum_{i}A_{i,i}
$$

矩阵的迹拥有下面性质：

- $Tr(A)=Tr(A^T)$。
- $Tr(AB)=Tr(BA)$。
- $Tr$是线性函数，即$Tr(A+B)=Tr(A)+Tr(B)$，$Tr(\alpha A)=\alpha Tr(A)$

对于任意矩阵$A$，有$\left\|A\right\|_2=Tr(AA^T)$。

# 伪逆

矩阵逆运算仅对方阵有定义。给定$n\times m$的矩阵$A$，假设我们希望实现一个$A$的左逆$B$，满足$Ax=y\Rightarrow x=By$。

记$A$的特征值分解为$A=UDV$，定义$A$的伪逆定义为

$$
A^+=VD^+U^T
$$

$D^+$表示将$D$中所有非$0$元素取倒数，并转置得到的矩阵。

对于给定的$y$，如果$y$处于$A$的列空间中，$A^+y$表示$L^2$范数最小的向量，满足$A(A^+y)=y$，$\min(\left\|A^+y\right\|)$。而如果$y$不处于$A$的列空间，则$A^+y$表示到$A$的列空间的$L^2$范数距离最小的向量，即$\min(\left\|A(A^+y)-y\right\|_2)$。

# 行列式

$A$的行列式记做$\det(A)$，是一个实数。$det(A)$等于$A$的所有特征值的乘积。我们可以认为$\|det(A)\|$描述的是所有特征值的绝对值的乘积，如果某个特征值为$0$，则$det(A)$在某个维度上将不存在高度，导致整体的体积最终为$0$。

# 奇异值分解

不是每个矩阵都可以做特征值分解，但是任意矩阵都可以被奇异值分解。类似与特征值分解，奇异值分解如下：

$$
A=UDV^T
$$

假设$A$是$m\times n$矩阵，那么$U$是$m\times m$矩阵，$D$是$m\times n$矩阵，$V$是$n\times n$矩阵。

其中$U$和$V$都是单位正交矩阵。$U$的列向量称为左奇异向量，$V$的列向量称为右奇异向量，$D$的对角线元素称为奇异值。

$A$的左奇异向量是$AA^T$的特征向量，而右奇异向量是$A^TA$的特征向量。而$A$的奇异值是$A^TA$的特征值的平方根。

# 线性方程组

## 四个空间

对于$n\times m$矩阵$A$，记$R(A)$表示$A$的行空间，$C(A)$表示$A$的列空间，$N(A)$表示$A$的右零空间，$N(A^T)$为$A$的左零空间。

- $rank(C(A))=rank(R(A))$
- $R(A)+N(A)=n$，$C(A)+N(A^T)=m$
- $R(A)\perp N(A)$，$C(A)\perp N(A^T)$",

# Swagger Sample App

## Overview
This is a java project to build a stand-alone server which implements the Swagger spec.  You can find out more about both the spec and the framework at http://swagger.io.  

### To run (with Maven)
To run the server, run this task:
<pre>
mvn package -Dlog4j.configuration=file:./conf/log4j.properties jetty:run
</pre>

This will start Jetty embedded on port 8002.

### Testing the server
Once started, you can navigate to http://localhost:8002/api/api-docs to view the Swagger Resource Listing.
This tells you that the server is up and ready to demonstrate Swagger.

### Using the UI

The sample application hosts the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) at http://localhost:8002. You can use that to browse the API.

### Applying an API key
The sample app has an implementation of the Swagger ApiAuthorizationFilter.  This restricts access to resources based on api-key.  There are two keys defined in the sample app:

<li>- default-key</li>

<li>- special-key</li>

When no key is applied, the ""default-key"" is applied to all operations.  If the ""special-key"" is entered, a number of other resources are shown in the UI, including sample CRUD operations.  Note this behavior is similar to that on http://developer.wordnik.com/docs but the behavior is entirely up to the implementor.",

# ts-webpack-virtual-resolve

A simple example of how to achieve resolving a virtual module using [TypeScript][typescript] in [Webpack][webpack]!

## Problem Description

There is a range of scenarios where it does not make much sense not to have a file in a fixed directory for being able to resolve it. Let's suppose we have the following situation. We have one module specified as below:

```js
// app.js
const configuration = require('./configuration');

/* ... */

// use configuration.path
```

The configuration module could originate from a file, e.g., *configuration.json*, however, we may have the situation that we have multiple configurations and decide (during compile-time) which one to use. For simplicity, we assume that we have just two files - *configuration-prod.json* and *configuration-test.json*.

Obviously, we already know which one to take, but we don't want to:

- change the reference(s) in all the modules (e.g., going from `require('./configuration')` to `require('./configuration-prod.json')`)
- always copy the file to overwrite *configuration.json* in the right file

The solution would be to change the module resolution dynamically. This seems most elegant, but unfortunately, there is no such function in Webpack that allows us to redirect paths.

Fortunately, the whole thing described above can be solved quite simple. We can pretend to have pre-loaded the source, even though we never touched the path. That way Webpack will always get the correct content from memory, even though no physical path exists. This is what I call a virtual module. Having solved this problem why do we need to have the current repository at all? Is there something left to cover?

Indeed there is - instead of using plain JavaScript (independent of the exact dialect or transformation rules) we now want to use TypeScript. We want to use it to improve code robustness and introduce some contracts that need to be fulfilled between the different modules. The problem with this check origines now from using TypeScript itself. In order to make the check TypeScript needs to perform the module resolution. So even though we inject a virtual module into Webpack, TypeScript does not know about it and will complain.

Now we have two options:

1. We surrounder and declare the given module as ""any"", such that TypeScript will stop complaining, but also won't do any type checks on the module
2. We try to make it work

Of course this repository exits to show one solution to the problem.

Reminder: This is one way of how the problem occurs (using TypeScript)

```ts
// app.ts
import * as configuration from './configuration';

/* ... */

// use configuration.path
```

## Proposed Solution

In order to get things working we introduce the following dependencies:

* The [awesome-typescript-loader][atsl] to handle the TypeScript files / compilation
* The [virtual-module-webpack-plugin][vmwp] to manipulate the Webpack cache

Additionally, we require a simple helper to generate / update TypeScript declaration files for our virtual modules. These declaration files may be omitted from source control, however, for providing a better user experience (i.e., developer experience) I like to place them in source control. Also as some of these declaration files may not be generated, but rather be written by hand, I tend to treat them all in the same way (thus adding these files to Git seems appropriate to me).

As a prerequisite TypeScript needs to be available in version 2.1 or higher. This allows us to write a *tsconfig.json* like below.

```json
{
  ""compilerOptions"": {
    ""baseUrl"": ""."",
    ""paths"": {
      ""configuration"": [""src/config""]
    }
  }
}
```

The properties `baseUrl` and `paths` go hand in hand. The `paths` property allows us to tell TypeScript about the resolution paths for the named modules. This is quite handy to use a more universal and shorter approach of referencing the virtual module.

Our original source file can therefore be changed:

```ts
// app.ts
import * as configuration from 'configuration';

/* Rest unchanged */
```

The emitted code from TypeScript will still looks as the code above (referencing *src/configuration*). The important part here is that we do not specify the extension (we left that out before, but now we really rely on that). Essentially, we want to abuse the following:

- TypeScript will resolve this to a *configuration.d.ts* file, i.e., some module declaration
- Webpack will resolve this to *configuration.json*, which will be available from the cache

After transpiling with TypeScript (which will work against the pure module declaration) we end up with a JavaScript file similar to the following:

```js
// app.g.js
var configuration = require('./configuration');

// ...
```

Webpack now does its magic and performs the final module resolution, which ends up being roughly equivalent to the following code (excerpt):

```js
// in bundle.js
var configuration = __webpack_require__(id_of_configuration_json);

// ...
```

This way we can inject any code as long as the virtual module is resolved by a physical shim in TypeScript and the virtual, i.e., cached file in Webpack.

The big advantage of this method is that it will also work with IDEs or text editors (e.g. VSCode). The included TypeScript compiler and language services will already work against the declaration file(s) that are specified via the *tsconfig.json*. As a result, the build will not only succeed (or fail) via Webpack, but real problems will already shown beforehand. The disadvantage is, of course, that real files (the declaration files) need to be present on the disk, therefore removing part of the virtual.

If the virtual modules all share the same interface (independent of the generation) then this method makes great sense.

## Available Scenarios

The example repository code contains three different scenarios. All three work similar, but can be distinguished from the details.

1. Resolving a dynamically generated TypeScript file, i.e., the file still needs to be handled from the TypeScript compiler and is only made available to the TypeScript module system via a manually written declaration. Using the TypeScript compiler even this declaration file could be updated automatically.
2. Resolving a JSON file in general. Even though `require` would work here, TypeScript would in general complain that the JSON is not a valid module.
3. Resolving a JSON file from a chosen list (similar to the configuration example outlined in the previous sections).
4. Resolving a generated JSON object. As an example some constants are merged together during compile-time. The result has to be used from the application.

Most importantly, all share the same trick as discussed above: We present TypeScript a declaration file to satisfy it's type checking needs.

## Summary

The following sequence diagram illustrates the build process.

![Illustration of the build process](process.png)

Most notably, the diagram assumes that a declaration file already exists. It is not assuming that an automatic update is available or even mandatory.

The two important parts of the diagram is the resolution of TypeScript to a declaration file and the same resolution from Webpack to the virtual file. The rest is a rough equivalent of the usual Webpack flow in a rather simple form.

# <a name=""specify-an-older-net-framework-version-for-debugging-c-visual-basic-f""></a>Określanie starszej wersji .NET Framework debugowania (C#, Visual Basic, F#)

Debuger Visual Studio obsługuje debugowanie starszych wersji programu Microsoft .NET Framework a także bieżącą wersję. Jeśli uruchamiasz aplikację z Visual Studio, debuger zawsze może zidentyfikować poprawną wersję .NET Framework dla debugowanej aplikacji. Jeśli jednak aplikacja jest już uruchomiona i rozpoczniesz debugowanie przy użyciu polecenia **Dołącz** do , debuger może nie zawsze być w stanie zidentyfikować starszą wersję .NET Framework. W takim przypadku zostanie wyświetlony komunikat o błędzie z komunikatem:

``` cmd
The debugger has made an incorrect assumption about the .NET Framework version your application is going to use.
```

W rzadkich przypadkach, w których występuje ten błąd, można ustawić klucz rejestru, aby wskazać debugerowi, której wersji użyć.

### <a name=""to-specify-a-net-framework-version-for-debugging""></a>Aby określić wersję .NET Framework debugowania

1. Poszukaj w katalogu Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework, aby znaleźć wersje .NET Framework zainstalowane na komputerze. Numery wersji wyglądają podobnie do tych:

    `V1.1.4322`

    Zidentyfikuj prawidłowy numer wersji i zanotuj go.

2. Uruchom Edytor **rejestru** (regedit).

3. W **Edytorze rejestru** otwórz folder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE rejestru.

4. Przejdź do: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\AD7Metrics\Engine\\ {449EC4CC-30D2-4032-9256-EE18EB41B62B}

    Jeśli klucz nie istnieje, kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy pozycję HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\AD7Metrics\Engine, a następnie kliknij **pozycję Nowy klucz.** Nadaj noweowi kluczowi nazwę `{449EC4CC-30D2-4032-9256-EE18EB41B62B}` .

5. Po przejściu do adresu {449EC4CC-30D2-4032-9256-EE18EB41B62B}poszukaj w kolumnie **Name** i znajdź klucz CLRVersionForDebugging.

   1. Jeśli klucz nie istnieje, kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy pozycję {449EC4CC-30D2-4032-9256-EE18EB41B62B}, a następnie kliknij pozycję Nowa wartość **ciągu**. Następnie kliknij prawym przyciskiem myszy nową wartość ciągu, kliknij polecenie **Zmień nazwę** i wpisz `CLRVersionForDebugging` .

6. Kliknij dwukrotnie **pozycję CLRVersionForDebugging.**

7. W **polu Edytuj ciąg** wpisz .NET Framework wersji w **polu** Wartość. Na przykład: V1.1.4322

8. Kliknij przycisk **OK**.

9. Zamknij Edytor **rejestru**.

     Jeśli po rozpoczęciu debugowania nadal pojawia się komunikat o błędzie, sprawdź, czy numer wersji został poprawnie wprowadzony w rejestrze. Sprawdź również, czy używasz wersji programu .NET Framework obsługiwanej przez Visual Studio. Debuger jest zgodny z bieżącą .NET Framework i poprzednimi wersjami, ale może nie być zgodny z przyszłymi wersjami.

# Limiting docker container memory

## Enabling swap

* `docker info` - If the output of this command contains **WARNING: Noswaplimitsupport**, then do the following as root user (below steps are applicable for ubuntu)
  * Add `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1""` to **/etc/default/grub**. Save the file
  * Execute the command `update-grub`
  * Reboot the system
* Verify if the warning has disappeared after reboot with `docker info` (no need to execute as root)

## Limiting container memory

By default, a container can use all of its host's available memory.

```bash
# Take a note of the below commands output
docker info | grep -i memory

# launch a container with the below command and verify its
#  memory using docker container stats
docker container run --rm -it --name mem_no_limit alpine:latest sh

# In the ""MEM USAGE / LIMIT"" column, the limit should be the same as the
# docker info output
docker container stats mem_no_limit

# check memory stats
docker container inspect mem_no_limit | grep -i Memory
```

* From the container launched above, try the `free -m` command to check the available memory (should be a number close to the `docker info` command output).

There are multiple ways to limit a container's memory usage.

* Restricting memory while building the docker image. `docker image build --help`
* While launching the container using the **--memory** option. `docker container run --help`
* By associating the container with a **memory limit set cgroup**. `docker container run` accepts a **cgroup** option as well.

## Memory limit using the run command's memory option

* Memory limit units k(KB), m(MB), g(GB) can be used.

```bash
# launch a container with the below command and verify its
#  memory using docker container stats
docker container run --rm -it --name mem_with_limit --memory 512m  alpine:latest sh

# In the ""MEM USAGE / LIMIT"" column, the limit should be the 512mb
docker container stats mem_with_limit
```

* `ContainerSwapMemory = (MemorySwap - Memory)`

* When the memory limit is set, **by default the container's swap memory value is twice the allowed memory value.** This means the container's allowed swap memory is same in size as its allowed memory.

```bash
# check the MemorySwap and memory columns
docker container inspect mem_with_limit | grep -i Memory
```

* To **disable swap**, set the **--memory** and **--memory-swap** options to the same value.

```bash
docker container run --rm -it --name mem_with_limit --memory 512m --memory-swap 512m alpine:latest sh

docker container stats mem_with_limit | grep -i Memory
```

**NOTE**: Memory option sets only the memory limit on the container. But inside the container, the memory is still same as the output of the `docker info` command. In the case where the container is launched with the memory option set, the container is killed when the memory usage exceeds the allowed value.

```bash
# observe the output of the below commands.
# Both see the available memory as same
docker container run --rm -it --name mem_no_limit alpine:latest free -m

docker container run --rm -it --name mem_with_limit --memory 512m --memory-swap 512m alpine:latest free -m
```

* To know if the container is killed because of **OutOfMemory(OOM)**, use the `docker container inspect` command.

```bash
# Limit the memory to 50MB and disable swap, and try to use 60MB
# Below command output look like
# stress: info: [1] dispatching hogs: 0 cpu, 0 io, 1 vm, 0 hdd
# stress: dbug: [1] using backoff sleep of 3000us
# stress: dbug: [1] setting timeout to 1s
# stress: dbug: [1] --> hogvm worker 1 [7] forked
# stress: dbug: [7] allocating 62914560 bytes ...
# stress: dbug: [7] touching bytes in strides of 4096 bytes ...
# stress: FAIL: [1] (416) <-- worker 7 got signal 9
# stress: WARN: [1] (418) now reaping child worker processes
# stress: FAIL: [1] (422) kill error: No such process
# stress: FAIL: [1] (452) failed run completed in 0s
docker container run --name memory_limit_stress --memory 50m --memory-swap 50m -it progrium/stress --vm 1 --vm-bytes 62914560 --timeout 1s


# prints ""OOMKilled"": true
docker container inspect memory_limit_stress | grep -i oom
```

* When memory limit is set while launching the container, the same reflects in the cgroup file **memory.limit_in_bytes**. Get the **docker container ID** and search for the same inside the **`/sys/fs/cgroup/memory`** directory, if the cgroup is not known (default cgroup is **docker**).

```bash
# This should print the memory limit set
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/docker/<container_id>/memory.limit_in_bytes
```

title: Cost of Ownership
subtitle: So You Want to Buy a Guzheng
image: /img/white-background.jpeg
sections:
  - text: >-
      I have good and bad news. The good news: getting started with guzheng is
      cheaper than with just about any other instrument out there. The bad news:
      it's still a chunk of money. A new player should expect to spend $700 USD
      on the instrument and related equipment. Lessons add another $1,000-$2,000
      USD per year. That's $1,700-$2,700 for the year or $140 - $225 per month
      for the first year. Equipment costs should almost completely vanish in the
      second year - $50 for replacement tape, picks, and maybe a string or two.




      For context: Beginner guitars and ukuleles are typically cheaper than
      guzheng while violins and cellos are more. Quality beginner violin
      packages cost about $1,200 before lessons. Cello packages can easily cost
      $3,000 before lessons. $700 for a performance-ready guzheng, then, is a
      great deal. If you are really lucky you can get a used instrument for even
      less.




      Let’s get to it! All price estimates are made in August of 2018 for
      players in North America.
  - heading: The Instrument
    text: >-
      ## New - $500-$20,000


      ![Dunhuang Guzheng](/img/dunhuang-guzheng_compressed.jpg)


      Instruments sold in the United States of America start at about $500 USD.
      Even the lowest-price ones sound great. A reputable model from a reputable
      seller will serve you for years. Do pay attention to shipping costs when
      shopping. Some sellers include shipping in the total price while others
      charge for it separately. Shipping a guzheng in North America is generally
      around $100.  




      It is also possible to have an instrument shipped from Asia but it's
      usually more trouble than it is worth. Entry-level models range from $150
      USD for instruments you will regret buying to $350 for reasonable
      versions. Those numbers may sound lower but shipping makes up the
      difference. An English-Language store in Beijing quotes $205 to ship to
      the USA from China while a store in Singapore quotes $278 USD. Add that to
      the $350 purchase price and you’ve already exceeded $500. Shipping delays,
      customs, and changing import restrictions can add to the headache. It is
      therefore a wiser choice for a beginner to purchase domestically. 




      Mass-market concert-quality guzheng top out at about $5,000. Beyond that
      you enter the realm of specialty and master-craftsman instruments. The top
      price for these tends to be about $20,000. For example, the wonderful
      HKZhengArt currently has a Dunhuang for $18,000 USD while
      ChineseZither.net has a Mitsuya Koto quoted at $16,800. One-of-a-kind
      instruments can retail for more but the price has little to do with the
      sound quality. The most expensive guzheng I have ever seen was accented
      with gold and jade and sold for ~$128,000 at the Music China 2018
      tradeshow. You can always find something more expensive if you know where
      to look.




      But back to students: $1000 is higher than any new student should pay.
      Anything above $1,000 is a jaw-dropping luxury. It's the equivalent of
      getting a convertible for a student driver. Great if you can afford it but
      entirely unnecessary. I know musicians who have performed for decades on
      mid-level instruments. Any quality guzheng, even entry-level instruments
      in the $500 range will provide personal enjoyment for decades as long as
      they are cared for properly.  $800 instruments will wow and amaze. 




      If you do wish to purchase something more expensive, please do! They are
      works of art that are meant to be shared and enjoyed. Just make sure you
      are buying them because you want to, not because you feel you have to in
      order to play well.


      ## Used - $200-$800


      Finding a guzheng on the used market in North America is all about
      location and luck. Major websites such as eBay, Craigslist, and Kijiji
      average 2-3 used guzheng a month, country-wide. Facebook Marketplace seems
      to have more, with 5 active the day of this writing (NY, CA, DE, WA). Many
      are priced close to what you would pay for a new instrument so weigh
      potential savings against the risks of buying used. Guzheng are more
      commonly found for sale on the coasts but a few pop up every year in the
      interiors. It is possible to find a damaged but playable instrument for
      around $200 if you are patient. Increase your budget to $400 -$500 and
      you'll have better luck.




      $350, $450, and $800 USD are common prices for instruments.  Use our Buy
      Used guide to help negotiate price. Read listings carefully and discuss
      price with the seller. I've seen factory-fresh instruments listed as
      '""antique"" and 25-year-old war horses with obvious body damage listed as
      ""like new"".




      I put the top of the used range at $800 because I do not recommend buying
      a used instrument for more if it is your first. $800 can get you a very
      nice new instrument from a quality brand without the risks of hidden
      problems - or the risk of getting fooled into paying more than an
      instrument is worth. High-end instruments do occasionally come up for sale
      but they are rare. I’ve seen 4 high quality guzheng for sale in the last
      18 months (Feb 2019). Everything else priced above $800 was, by my
      estimate, over priced.




      Buying used can save you money and is great for the community and the
      environment, but remember that students need support. Support can come
      from members of the community or through the staff of a quality store. If
      you have contacts in the guzheng community then buying used is wonderful.
      If you don’t know anyone, buying from a store means you can go to them for
      help.




      ## Rentals - ~$600/year


      Rentals are a great way to check a student's interests. Rent a guzheng for
      a few months and if you or your child are still interested, go ahead and
      buy one. From what I've seen stores and some teachers ask about $50 USD
      per month. Rent for a year and you'll spend as much as it would cost to
      buy your own. I like to think of it this way: if you commit to play the
      instrument for one year, you've given yourself a budget of $600. Buy an
      instrument for that much. At the end of the year you can keep playing for
      free or resell it to get a little money back and pass the joy on to
      someone else.
  - heading: Nails
    text: >-
      1st year cost: $0-$12


      ![Guzheng Nails](/img/img_20181213_161835-1-_compressed.jpg)


      Nails, picks, or plectra, as they are called, are the next thing to get
      after purchasing an instrument. Any hard material can be used to make
      nails though different materials provide different sounds. The best nails
      are solid and rigid. The go-to materials used to be plastic, resin, and
      metal. A type of turtle shell came into vogue a few decades ago but
      unsustainable hunting drove the turtles near extinction. It's better for
      the future of guzheng players and for the environment to use other
      materials while the turtle population regrows. Plastics, resins, stone,
      bone, bamboo, and metal are all options. Read more about nail materials
      here.




      Nails range from less than $0.75 USD per nail to $5.00 or more. That is a
      range of $6-40 USD total for the 8 picks needed to cover both hands.
      Instruments are often sold with a basic set of nails - thin plastic sets
      that are very similar to guitar picks. These are fine for new players and
      can last children for years. In fact, if you ever lose one of these you
      can fashion a replacement out of a guitar pick. 




      Higher quality nails tend to be thicker with more care given to their
      shape. They can include tapered edges, curved surfaces, and sculpted
      indentations for your fingers. Read more about nail shapes here. 




      An intermediate set of thick plastic nails should cost about $12 USD.
  - heading: Tape
    text: >-
      1st year: $12


      ![Guzheng finger tape](/img/guzheng-tapes_compressed.jpg)


      Tape is used to attach the nails to fingers. You'll want a breathable tape
      with an adhesive that doesn't bother your skin. Cloth tapes are common
      though other forms of tape can work. A good place to start is with guzheng
      or pipa tape from an online music store. A single roll should be about
      $1-2 before shipping. Woven First Aid or medical tape from a pharmacy may
      work as well. 




      You'll typically want lengths of 2.5 to 4 inches per finger. Assuming you
      tape four fingers every week, a 5-meter roll of tape will last about 8
      weeks.
  - heading: Strings
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$30


      ![](/img/guzheng-strings_compressed.jpg)


      Strings can last for years. If one happens to break you can order a
      replacement for $1.50-$3 USD. Complete sets range from $30-$70. String
      quality has a large impact on instrument sound so buy the best strings you
      can afford. Most new instruments come with several replacement strings as
      part of their purchase price. 




      Purchase ""Type B"" strings. They are an improvement over the older standard
      string, Type A. Most modern instruments are built for Type B strings and
      the higher tension they require. “Type C” strings are used for diatonic
      tunings which beginners don't need to worry about.
  - heading: Stands
    text: >-
      1st year: $0 (or $30 or $60)


      ![Guzheng Stands](/img/folding-guzheng-stands_compressed.jpg)


      Stands are typically included with instruments both new and old. If you do
      need a set you can expect to pay $60 for a two-piece set like those
      pictured or $100 or more for a 3-piece stand. Two piece stands are folding
      legs that support each end of the instrument. 3-piece stands are made of
      two vertical supports that are held in place by a crosspiece. 2-piece
      stands are more portable, while 3-piece stands are more stable and look
      fancier. Guzheng stands usually position the head of the instrument higher
      than the tail, encouraging better posture for left-hand techniques.




      An alternative to purpose built guzheng stands are keyboard stands.
      X-brace keyboard stands sell for $30-$60 USD and are more adjustable and
      easier to find than guzheng stands. They can be adjusted to fit your
      personal height preference, especially valuable if you have long legs.
      Just make sure the stand you want to purchase can support your instrument
      in the right places at the right height. Be mindful of the stand’s
      stability. 




      X-brace stands are often used to allow a performer to play while standing
      up, but this can place the supports too close to the center of the
      instrument, making it wobble during play. Other types of keyboard stands
      can be used in the place of guzheng stands. Just make sure they are the
      right height, width, and depth for your instrument. You may need to add
      felt or cloth rests to protect the bottom of your guzheng.
  - heading: Seat
    text: >-
      1st year: $0




      Special stools can be purchased but they aren't needed. Most players use
      whatever chair is available. Use one from around your house or go to a
      second-hand store to find a chair or stool you like sitting on. The most
      important thing is to make sure you sit in an ergonomic position with
      proper posture when you play. The chair should be high enough that your
      feet are flat on the floor and your thigh bones are parallel to the ground
      or sloping slightly downward towards your knees. Padded seats can make
      longer practice sessions far more enjoyable.
  - heading: Tuner
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$20


      ![Guzheng Tuners](/img/guzheng-tuners_compressed.jpg)


      Simple tuners are often included in new instrument purchases. They can
      also be purchased separately. Any guitar tuner that can distinguish
      between natural and sharp notes will work. There are also a variety of
      free tuning apps available for smartphones. Specialty guzheng tuners can
      be purchased for $5-$20 USD.
  - heading: Case
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$60.


      ![Guzheng Case](/img/green-guzheng-case_compressed.jpg)


      Most new instruments come with a soft case. If yours didn't, buy one.
      Cases protect your guzheng and make it easy to carry. Soft cases are
      essentially fabric and won't offer much protection from collisions but
      will keep out dust. They range from $50-$70 and can be made waterproof.
      Hard cases offer full protection but can be heavier and larger than the
      instrument. Hard cases are difficult to find in North America. I know of
      only two retailers that have hard cases for sale: a full-weight case for
      $500 and a fiberglass case for $700.




      As of May 2019:  I’ve also seen cases for sale from shippers in China.
      English-language Alibaba has a fiberglass case for $350 (including
      shipping) and AliExpress has a standard hard case for $250 (including
      shipping). Chinese language site Tmall had a standard case for $170
      including shipping “overseas” and fiberglass cases for $300-400, shipping
      not included.




      I know this is as much as a beginner’s instrument. If you don’t expect to
      travel much a soft case will be fine. If you are traveling you should
      invest in a padded hard case.
  - heading: Humidity Control
    text: >-
      1st year: $60 plus cost of water and electricity




      When the cold weather comes you will need a humidifier to keep your
      guzheng from cracking and a hygrometer to measure the humidity in the air.
      You can read more in the Care and Maintenance page. Budget around $60 USD
      for a humidifier and hygrometer.
  - heading: Learning Materials
    text: >-
      1st year: $0-$40




      There are many options available to you. There are video lessons and
      training materials available online in English for free. The
      Chinese-language guzheng websites have loads more. 




      A book of lessons will typically cost you from $5-$20 USD. Any given book
      could give you enough for several months to several years depending on how
      quickly you work through it and how much the book has. Some teachers ask
      you to purchase a book to learn alongside lessons while others may provide
      the learning materials for free. Every person’s final cost will vary.
  - heading: Lessons
    text: >-
      1st year: $1500-$2500




      Learning with an actual teacher provides more information and yields
      better outcomes than self-learning alone. Self learning is great! But a
      single lesson with a teacher can be worth several hours of personal trial
      and error. It can also prevent you from developing posture and technique
      problems that you have to overcome later. That said, lessons are the
      largest cost of playing the guzheng. Your best bet is to find the balance
      of lessons and self-learning that work for you.




      The estimate that a year of lessons costs $1500-$2500 assumes a weekly
      lesson of between $30 and $50 per week for 48 weeks. That leaves 4 weeks
      left over for vacations, busy schedules, and the like. To spread your
      budget you could take lessons every two weeks and fill in the time with
      extra practice and self study. You can also look for group lesson
      discounts to defer the cost among several students. An increasing number
      of teachers are offering video lessons as well - perhaps you could work
      out a mix of in-person lessons and video checkups. Discuss your particular
      balance with your teacher. In my estimate at the top of the page I drop
      the numbers to $1,000-$2,000 as most students go less than 48 times per
      year. (Summer trips, school conflicts, etc.)




      And there you have it! If you have any questions about these numbers or
      any of the topics mentioned feel free to send an email below.

# BackupCron
BackupCron is a simple tool that periodically makes backups of your website and database. Initially designed for a WordPress website, you can expect it to work on any web based projects. To completely understand how this tool works, it is advised to look in to the code =)

The tool does the following:
* Back up a PHP project
* Back up a MySQL Database
* Uploads to webdav cloud environment

This tool is compatible with [TransIP Stack](https://www.transip.nl/stack/).

## Requirements
* Storage cloud environment that supports Webdav connection
* PHP 7.1 or later

## Getting started
This tool can be downloaded by visiting the [releases](https://github.com/samihsoylu/BackupCron/releases) page, or using git to clone.

Once downloaded and extracted, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the dummy text within the environment file to your correct credentials.

For reference:
```
    [app][backups_dir] is the path to a temporary directory of your choice `/tmp/` would suffice
    [app][uploads_dir] path to the directory you wish to periodically back up

    [webdav] credentials to your cloud
    [webdav][sql_backup_dir] directory path, where to store your database on your cloud
    [webdav][uploads_backup_dir] directory path, where to store your files
    
    [stmp] your smtp credentials for sending emails
    
    [db] credentials to the database that you wish to periodically back up
    
    [debug] specify a ""to"" email address for debugging purposes
```

Once configured, you must set up a cron job that will periodically execute the `cron.php` file on your web server. The `cron.php` file creates backups and uploads them to your cloud.

"# Tump's Time? It's Story's Time

`legacy`

Mention Rand

Tump is TV, incarnate, and they're both dying

A stress test of the Office.

Punk is the fountain of youth.

There are many reasons - some obvious, some not - why political and ideological discourse will never be a part of _Extratone_, editorially. Redundancy, primarily, coupled with a lack of any useful authority in the workings of functional, sovereign operations, on my part. But - though mine may be aloof and irrelevant - I cannot ignore the unique, authentically-youthful perspectives offered by the staff & community on some very significant questions that are being asked as a direct result of the United States' 45th Presidency.

As such, I have created _Tump_ - this standalone section - to present what of them we articulate for any interested readers. However, it will not be listed in any sitebound navigation, meaning its only two gateways are through 1)piggybacking on content with independent value and 2)direct link, meaning you'll only see it if you _seek it out_.

That stated, allow me to contradict myself.

---

Frankly, after hearing <NAME>apper sincerely ask ""are we [CNN] 'fake news?,'"" I am _desperate_ to do whatever possible to ensure I never have to repeat the experience.

I am therefore required - in little authority or relevance - to talk about the _breadth_ of the cultural impact of The Fact of Tump, especially on the Grand Old Church of American journalism.

He is the least _Presidential_ individual to ever occupy the White House, which - from what I've gathered - is a sentiment shared by the majority of Americans. Those Donnie supporters I've been exposed to over the past 4-5 months have all expressed a respect - an inconcealable _need_, even - for his **honesty**. In September, I published a [hasty plea](https://medium.com/@AsphaltApostle/a-hasty-case-for-an-ingenuine-white-house-9476aedd73ae#.1lishwe2o) for reflection on the dangerous and misplaced power of this craving - my first political words, ever. At the time, I decided it was not appropriate or desirable for me to say such a thing with _Extratone_, but we have an honest President, now, and there is nothing he'll not eventually touch.

Yes, I have been consuming the news. Like many, in a wider stream than ever, and you're right! In inauguration sizes, analysis of the media's coverage of terrorist attacks, and all manner of other googlable narratives, he is _Hawking Huge Hokum_, but his lies are obviously not designed to be believed, which makes them something else entirely.

What makes him _honest_, though, is actually the precise opposite. His consistent & obvious lack of discipline should reassure those of you concerned about integrity in a profound way. Idiots are more trustworthy the more ridiculous they are, yeah? It is tremendously inefficient to be a spectacular crony.

There was such a desire for _honesty_ in this country that some of the most reasonable, hard-working, and pragmatic people I've ever known were willing to accept the consequences of bowing to a circus in order to finally guarantee that their President is _incapable_ of anything but transparency.

What has _not_ been in doubt these past three weeks: Tump has set immediately upon the talking points he carried with him around the country throughout his campaign. at best speed. He may even have set a record for it; I know he did for the fastest-dropping approval rating.

---

**But how and why did this happen, again?**

_Extratone_ has a love for counterculture because it is the most essential endeavor to youth's furthering of progress. I'm supposed to be pretty good at differentiating between it and its popular compliment, so let's hope this is worthwhile.

**Tump's Presidency is counterculture** in a sense that eases the working-class famishment for righteousness in top-tier power. Or at least, that's the idea. Just seconds into his seat, he was [spiting the conventions](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384774/trump-microphone-speech-long-neck-shure-sm57) of inaugural address delivery. He is there to break ridiculous records, make us all uncomfortable, and embarrass the shit out of the country - except for those few young people who've mistaken his shtick for **punk**. Their way of thought and its plenty of misconceptions is the most frightening component of the whole situation.

I know punks; they don't like Tump.

If I may presume to define it - **Punk** is counterculture with a broadly pro-culture motive. Punks appear as caricatures because - whether they care to acknowledge it or not - they use their abrasion with society to keep it moving. It is a _necessary_ function in the development and ongoing maintenance of any community. It is the true-to-life _fountain of youth_. Unfortunately, because all of us carry this knowledge at some depth, internally, it is often misused to justify outward tantrums from personal trauma. In most cases, like _BratShit_'s Milo Yiiiii, all parties (including the nesting mind, itself) are deceived. And Tump - especially when taken from the dominantly-relevant perspective of technology - is old. He is television, incarnate - an [antiliterate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?_r=0) President who spends hours a day forgoing the renaissance happening around him for _The Tube_.

When one assumes this crusade in ignorance, he writes & says things that will embarrass him for a lifetime. I would know. 

(I'll share that story one day, when I have the courage.)

Tump is not quite the type to do so, if you believe [<NAME>](https://theoutline.com/post/1048/donald-trump-can-t-stand-mckay-coppins), but regardless of his intentions, the task has been placed wholly upon him, and he's made it clear that he is a natural, but he will never be punk. It's impossible without youth, and Tump is old, especially when observed from the dominantly-relevant perspective of technology. He is television, incarnate - an [antiliterate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/us/politics/president-trump-white-house.html?_r=0) President who spends hours a day forgoing the renaissance happening around him for _The Tube_.

---

I've never needed to pay attention to moderate politics, so I'm not sure how long the White House's YouTube channel has been streaming its daily press briefings, but I'm highkey liberal in day-to-day life, now, thanks to recent events, and have been watching as many as I can. I find Sean Spicer's movements and speech infinitely fascinating, for whatever reason, and am much too amused when the [Twitter press](https://twitter.com/ashleyfeinberg/status/829402944814596100) calls him ""Spicey."" 

I think the fact of these compulsions is relevant because they echo what's happening to readership in the whole of the country. Though it's a few centuries late, at least Americans are [reading](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/sales-orwells-1984-following-trump-inauguration-propel-novel-top-amazon-bestseller-list-1603035) more science fiction. Ya know... the literary movement designed specifically to incite speculation and prepare you for this sorta thing. (Or prevent it, entirely.)

In this first chapter of Tump's presidency, the press have been the heroes, and it is American Journalism as an ethical and functional whole that will endure the most significant torment and triumph in the next four years.

Democracy rewards stupidity; the industry means to kill it, dead.

# Python Development Template (PDT)
This Python development template provides an example of how the full build environment configuration can easily be included in the design repository and mirrored across multiple developers.  This covers consistent development environment setup including virtual environments, Continuous Integration (CI) options and project management methods.

## Virtual Environment
Two options are considered for the setup of a virtual environment (venv)
1. Pip (simple)
  - Uses a requirements file (Requirements.txt)
  - https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/1.1/index.html
2. Pipenv (complex)
  - Uses a package list file and a security hashing file (Pipfile and Pipfile.lock)
  - https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Development Environment
Provides an overview for operation on different Operating Systems including setup of environment variables.  This also covers Integrated Development Environment (IDE) tools (i.e. PyCharm) and how to setup specific features.  This is now covered in the wiki which is available [here](https://github.com/NathanShanners/PDT/wiki/Development-Environments)

## Continuous Integration
This section covers options for integrating CI capability into Github.

## Project Management
This covers project management methods using Projects within Github.  This is focused around KanBan boards for planning, monitoring progress and also provides an option for logging work.

All details relating to this repository are available in the wiki section.

# rofi-proxy

`Rofi-proxy` is a plugin that allows you to manage [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) state with an external application.

To run rofi with plugin:

```bash
rofi -modi proxy -show proxy -proxy-cmd ""path_to_app""
```

There is also full support for `combi` mode:

```bash
rofi -modi combi -show combi -combi-modi ""proxy,drun"" -proxy-cmd ""path_to_app""
```

The ""-proxy-log"" option causes the `rofi-proxy` to log to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rofi/proxy.log` (or to `$HOME/.local/share/rofi/proxy.log` if the environment variable `XDG_DATA_HOME` not set):

```bash
rofi -modi proxy -show proxy -proxy-log -proxy-cmd ""path_to_app""
```

## Communication protocol

[Usage examples](https://github.com/ReanGD/rofi-proxy/tree/master/example).

After start it launches the `application` specified in ""-proxy-cmd"". The `application` can send to stdout messages which describes desired state of rofi in json format at any time. All messages must be in single-line json format and end with new line symbol.

### Messages from `rofi-proxy` to `application`

- Plugin sends an ""input"" message each time input line changes. For example:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""input"",
    ""value"": ""full_input_string""
}
```

- When custom (non-matched) input was entered, the plugin sends a message named ""select_custom_input"". For example:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""select_custom_input"",
    ""value"": ""input_string""
}
```

- When you select a line (press Enter), the plugin will send a ""select_line"" message with the data for this line. For example:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""select_line"",
    ""value"": {
        ""id"": ""id_string"",
        ""text"": ""line_text"",
        ""group"": ""group_string""
    }
}
```

- When you delete a line (press Shift+Delete by default), the plugin will send a ""delete_line"" message with the data for this line. For example:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""delete_line"",
    ""value"": {
        ""id"": ""id_string"",
        ""text"": ""line_text"",
        ""group"": ""group_string""
    }
}
```

- When the hotkey is pressed (see the rofi documentation for options ""-kb-custom-1"" ... ""-kb-custom-19""), the plugin sends a ""key_press"" message with the code ""custom_1"" .. ""custom_19"" (if interception for pressing `Escape` is allowed  then rofi will not close, but will send a message about the pressed key with the code ""cancel""). Currently displayed line will be sent in the value of the ""line"" field. For example:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""key_press"",
    ""value"": {
        ""key"": ""custom_1"",
        ""line"": {
            ""id"": ""id_string"",
            ""text"": ""line_text"",
            ""group"": ""group_string""
        }
    }
}
```

### Messages from `application` to `rofi-proxy`

At any time, `application` can send a single line json to the plugin describing the state of the rofi. Here's an example json with a full set of fields:

```json
{
    ""prompt"": ""prompt_text"",
    ""input"": ""user_input_text"",
    ""overlay"": ""overlay_text"",
    ""help"": ""help_text"",
    ""hide_combi_lines"": false,
    ""exit_by_cancel"": true,
    ""lines"": [
        {
            ""id"": ""id_text"",
            ""text"": ""display_text"",
            ""group"": ""group_text"",
            ""icon"": ""applications-internet"",
            ""filtering"": true,
            ""urgent"": false,
            ""active"": false,
            ""markup"": false
        },
        ...
    ],
}
```

All fields in the root json are optional. Here is a description of the fields in the root json:

| Name             | Type   | Start value | Description                                                              |

| icon      | string | none     | Icon name or full path to it (to use it, you need to run rofi with the ""-show-icons"" flag).                                 |
| filtering | bool   | true     | If the value is false, then this line is always displayed, regardless of filtering.                                         |
| urgent    | bool   | false    | Mark line as urgent.                                                                                                        |

#***Sample Size***

A sample is a percentage of the total population in statistics. You can use the data from a sample to make inferences about a population as a whole.

A sample size is a part of the population chosen for a survey or experiment.

*For example, you might take a survey of dog owner’s brand preferences. You won’t want to survey all the millions of dog owners in the country, so you take a sample size. That may be several thousand owners. The sample size is a representation of all dog owner’s brand preferences. If you choose your sample wisely, it will be a good representation.*

>Finding a sample size can be one of the most challenging tasks in statistics and depends upon many factors including the size of your original population.

"# Flexpad

Flexpad is a set of CSS classes to quickly make any flexbox layout using opinionated naming conventions.

## How it works

```
- Choose an axis for your container: x or y
- Think of a keypad:  1 2 4
                      4 5 6
                      7 8 9
- Pick the number corresponding to the alignment you want for your content
- Assign the class to your container:
```
```html
<div class=""x5"">
  <div>All centered</div>
</div>
<div class=""y1"">
  <div>Top left y aligned</div>
</div>
```

Have a look at [the demo](https://dherault.github.io/flexpad/) for all the 348 variations.

## Usage

#### JavaScript

`npm install flexpad --save`

Inject CSS:
```js
import 'flexpad/dist/flexpad.css'
// or, prefixed and minified
import 'flexpad/dist/flexpad.min.css'
```

Use with inline styles:
```js
import fp from 'flexpad'

const Menu = () => (
  <div style={fp('x5b')}>
    // ...
  </div>
)
```

"I would like to complete my Vivid collection, and I wish I had confirmation of all games released... can you help me?
They are all actually released? Especially the last two I've never found for sale.
Can you tell me as they came equipped with a slip case? looking here in the forum I read that some were released inside the envelopes instead of the crystal case!
Virtual Vivid is missing from your list and it came packaged in two different formats.
Also, Steamy Windows was never released.

Good Lord! Is that what those things are going for these days? I should have held onto mine for a bit before I sold them back in the day.

"Update about the Episcopal Monestary in southern California that burned in the wild fire last November.
But it wasn’t just the Brothers of the Order of the Holy Cross who lost their home. For many of the faithful in the Santa Barbara community and throughout the world, Mount Calvary was a spiritual home, a place to take refuge from the bustle of the day-to-day grind, or to work out life’s problems, or to simply meditate in silence, the quiet broken only by the breeze or by the piercing cries of hawks soaring high above. When news of the monastery’s destruction spread, there was an outpouring of sympathy for the brothers and grief over the devastation.
But not everything is lost.
Amid the ashes and the rubble, one icon of Mount Calvary remains standing, a silent symbol of salvation and triumph: the wrought-iron cross that was erected in 1949, shortly after the monastery was established.
Looking worse for wear from the firestorm that consumed everything around it, the cross nevertheless continues to tower over the burned-out courtyard. Its bronze ornamentation is tarnished, maybe even melted, but the flames of the Tea Fire were not strong enough to undo the delicate lacework of the body of the cross. Surrounded by charred, collapsed walls and burned-out debris, the cross still commands a reverence, perhaps even more so for having survived one of the most devastating wildfires in recent history.

"Charles Bean raised the spectre of hyperinflation, saying it is ""severely misguided"" to hope that a rise in prices would help Britain out of its current predicament.
His comments come amid growing suspicion that politicians around the world may eventually resort to inflation as a means of reducing what they owe in capital markets, and follow the Swedish Riksbank's decision to change its inflation target.
In an opinion piece for Telegraph.co.uk on Friday, Mr Bean writes: ""Some people have suggested that a bit of extra inflation now might actually be a good thing. After all, wouldn't it help to get the economy going by reducing the real value of public and private debt? This is severely misguided.
""Aside from the dubious morality of redistributing wealth from savers to borrowers, we have seen from past experience that a bit of inflation has a nasty habit of turning into a lot of inflation.""
He said the MPC should stick to its 2pc inflation target.",http://ad-orientem.blogspot.com/2010/06/bank-of-england-warns-of-inflation.html
"It does this by adding a second moving table, mounted perpendicular to the main fixed horizontal table. As layers are printed, this vertical table moves after each layer is printed, growing the part along the length of the machine rather than growing it upward. Thermwood’s “controlled cooling” print technology minimizes sag, which might otherwise pose a serious problem if the part were kept at an elevated temperature, as is common with traditional thermoplastic composite printing.
During development, Thermwood has vertically printed and validated the use of a variety of polymers, including high temperature materials such as PSU, PESU and PEI with good results. It appears that parts printed using VLP are structurally and functionally identical to parts printed in the traditional horizontal layer orientation.
This means that, just as with traditional horizontally printed LSAM parts, molds and tools printed using VLP maintain vacuum in an autoclave to aerospace standards right from the machine, without the need for any type of external coating.
During VLP printing, the growing part rides on Teflon coated stainless steel belts. The belts and table drives (which can be fitted to any LSAM that is at least 20 feet long), have been designed to process parts which weigh up to fifty thousand pounds. Thermwood believes that this is more than adequate for anything customers are considering today.
It requires time, labor and effort to machine mating surfaces, glue them together and wait for the adhesive to completely cure.
It may also require more than one bonding session for a larger part which typically requires more time and effort than simply printing the part in one piece.
Also, gluing printed parts together generally only works for certain room temperature or low temperature polymers.
Higher temperature materials are generally chemically and solvent resistant enough that they don’t bond well enough for autoclave use. This means if you want to 3D print a really large autoclave tool using a high temperature polymer, printing it in one piece is the only real option. Thermwood’s VLP now makes this both feasible and practical.
VLP has been designed so that the machine can be reconfigured from standard horizontal layer printing to vertical layer printing or back again in a matter of a few hours. It is clear that technology exists, right now today, to 3D print large autoclave capable aerospace tooling on a production basis. Thermwood has already been granted patent protection on key aspects of its Vertical Layer Print technology.
As previously announced, one of the initial parts printed with this system is a 12 foot long, carbon fiber reinforced ABS trim fixture for use in the production of the Boeing 777X aircraft.
Thermwood Corporation, located in Southern Indiana and established in 1969, offers both three & five axis CNC machining centers ideally suited for the production, fabrication & trimming of wood, plastics, non-ferrous metals, composites and other advanced materials. Thermwood also manufactures a line of Large Scale Additive Manufacturing (LSAM) systems for 3D printing of production tooling, molds, patterns, fixtures and plugs.
Thermwood is a US based company with dealers and distributors worldwide. In addition to machine manufacturing and software development, Thermwood has a technical service organization that provides support, machine installation, training, retrofits, custom programming and production assistance.

"Poor Helen Zille is in terrible trouble again despite a stellar career in public life. As the outgoing premier of the Western Cape, through a display of competence, diligence and selflessness she has shown the country she has devoted much of her life to, and the world, how a politician should go about the discharge of his or her duties and responsibilities. Unfortunately, these lessons are almost certainly lost on the country’s leaders who choose to adopt a very different approach to the wielding of power and it has a lot to do with using political leverage as a means towards self enrichment; something Mrs. Zille abhors and this is the background to the latest twitter-storm.
Unfortunately, ‘Literate Lion’ did not go into any details about the, “…plenty technology here that was eroded/annihilated by colonialism.” Clearly, he knows something most of us who have studied African history don’t and it would be fascinating to hear more from this learned individual on the subject. I wonder if he gave any thought to the origins of the device he was using to criticise so-called ‘white privilege’?
Apart from all the other questions raised by Mrs. Zille’s tweet, what is blindingly obvious is that in the course of this terse but explosive discourse we are also witness to yet another blatant example of anti-white racism. While Mrs. Zille is lambasted for using the term ‘black-privilege’ no such criticism is allowed when the term ‘white privilege’ is tossed out into the media mix with gay abandon. In other words, it’s quite acceptable to label every person with a white skin as ‘privileged’ but the converse is totally unacceptable even to more credible figures in the black intelligentsia like Professor Thuli Madonsela who drew accolades for her performance during her tenure as the country’s ‘Public Protector’.
My problem with Professor Madonsela (I’m constantly amazed at the fact that a country and continent blessed with so many professors seems to consistently get so much wrong) and millions who think like her is I reject with contempt the very concept of ‘white privilege’ that rolls so easily off their forked tongues. The recorded history of the European I have read can be summed up as one of industriousness, innovation, enterprise and fortitude which led to conquest and the creation of wealth which changed the world; in most cases for the better. Europeans did not prosper waiting for hand-outs; they improved their lives through careful contemplation and toil.
As I understand it, and I stand to be corrected by ‘Literate Lion’, the Africa that revealed itself to the early European explorers, missionaries and settlers was a primitive, violent and at times, terrifying place where might was right and the most basic human rights were of absolutely no consequence.
A perfect exemplar of this condition was Chaka Zulu; a genocidal maniac, now lionized in South Africa with an airport named after him. If Chaka had been a European, he would be posted up there alongside Mao, Stalin and Hitler as one of the monsters of the history of the world.
As a ‘privileged white’ brought up in Africa I have dealt with adversity all my life, simply because of the colour of my skin. For much of my early years I was, through no fault of my own, a citizen of an outlaw state, forbidden to travel abroad, drawn into war at a young age to try and block the path to power of a tyranny and vilified, simply because the international community had suddenly decided that Europeans had no right to be in Africa.
All my working life, because of my race, I and my contemporaries have been subjected to selective application of the laws and double standards. Marginalised in the country of my birth because of my ancestry and warned that whites should stay out of politics I looked on in horror as friends who ignored this threat were murdered and maimed. I was part of a community of good and kind people, stripped of their lives and livelihoods simply because of their ‘whiteness’ and yet I must accept that I and my people like me are somehow ‘privileged’?
Today I am witness to the heart-breaking plight of many of my destitute former colleagues and countrymen who are unable to survive without the help of friends and family. Because of their ‘whiteness’ they lost everything in Zimbabwe and have not been able to recover from the ensuing financial ruin. Many are of British ancestry; once proudly and bravely served Queen and country when the Union Jack flew but the people who now rule in the motherland have forsaken these former stalwarts and refuse to assist in the payment of their measly pensions.
The government of the country that encouraged many of these people to set forth into Africa in a bid to make the world a better place, spends £12 billion a year on aid projects, much of it on this continent helping despots retain power but not one penny for their own in times of desperate need. The simple reason; they are white and ‘privileged’!

"LE BOURGET: For certain flyers the window seat is a highly coveted position in the aircraft cabin. The aisle seat, of course, has its own advantages for the “vertically endowed” among us, as well as for those who need to – or want to – get up more frequently or have anxieties about being in cramped spaces. Still, the window seat is the best place to observe the miracle of flight, the subtle movement of the plane’s ailerons, the formation of clouds, the earth below, and the fascinating operational choreography that takes place on the airport apron.
Catering trucks lifting food-laden trolleys to the aircraft, luggage trains buzzing about and other aircraft taxiing by are just a few of the things window seat riders witness before takeoff and after landing. But in the near future, and beginning with Boeing 777-9X launch customer Lufthansa, passengers will start seeing something new and possibly astonishing when they gaze through the aircraft window on the ground. The folding functionality of the twinjet’s wingtips.
Late last year, Liebherr-Aerospace won a highly competitive bid to provide Boeing with the fold subsystem, the latch pin actuator and the secondary lock actuator, which will enable the 777X’s innovative wings to fold up and down on the two variants (the -8X and -9X).
The greater wingspan – a whopping 71.8m when the wingtips are unfolded for flight – allows Boeing to maximize fuel efficiency for its airline customers. But because the wings are so vast, many airports are simply not set up to deal with it. “For the new 777X, they have redesigned the wing to have a better flight performance and due to that they have stretched the wing. Now the wing is so long that when taxiing, it has to fold to be compatible with today’s airport gates, ” Liebherr-Aerospace senior executive Heiko Lütjens noted when he indulged RGN in a conversation at the Paris Air Show about what passengers should expect.
“We fold 7 meters exactly, 3.5m on each side. The aircraft is landing in a normal configuration [wings fully extended and locked with full diameter of 71.8m] and then we have so-called sectors, one sector is the runway, the other sector is the taxiway and from the runway to the taxiway we will have a given time [likely less than 20 seconds] to fold the wings, ” said Lütjens, who serves as managing director and CTO landing gear systems, flight control and actuation systems at Liebherr-Aerospace & Transportation SAS.
Only when the wingtips are folded up after landing can aircraft safely move beyond the runway without the risk of coming into contact with, for example, the wings of other large aircraft using the taxiways.
Knowing this, we suddenly become aware of just how critical the reliability of this technology really will be to airport operations and by association, to the passenger experience.
Should the wingtips not fold up and lock into place correctly after the aircraft lands, it could effectively paralyze an airport by delaying both departures and arrivals. On the flip side, before flight, the system “has to function flawlessly, of course, and for any failure then, the aircraft must stay on the ground – which is the case with any system that isn’t functioning flawlessly”, added Lütjens.
According to Liebherr-Aerospace, passengers should actually not hear loud noises or significantly feel the action of the mechanics driving this critical process. The company’s goal, working closely alongside Boeing designers and engineers, is to make the function as fast, smooth, reliable and safe as possible.
Nevertheless, the functionality is sure to captivate any 777X passenger with a view of its long and graceful wings.

"Kids! Get outdoors and get rid of glasses!
There has been additional evidence that the more time children spend outside the better chance they have to stay out of glasses. Majority of school age children need to wear glasses to correct nearsightedness or myopia. Myopia gets worse during the teenage growth spurt. It is imperative for elementary school children to have at least an hour of outdoor playtime. A review of scientific literature found a significant protective association between increasing time spent outdoors and prevalent myopia in nearly 10 000 children and adolescents aged ≤20 years. Each increase in hours per week of time spent outdoors was associated with a 2% reduced odds of myopia (nearsightedness). An increase in 7 hours of time spent outdoors per week (1 hr/d) equates to less nearsightedness.
There are a myriad of possible mechanisms by which spending time outdoors may protect against the development and progression of myopia (nearsightedness). They include increased release of retinal dopamine in response to sunlight (dopamine inhibits axial elongation in experimental myopia,and the protective effect can be blocked by the dopamine antagonist spiperone), increased light intensity outdoors (leading to pupil constriction, increasing depth of focus, decreasing blur, and slowing of eye growth), and the low accommodative demand (focusing) for distance vision.
Bright light has been shown to be protective of myopia in animal experiments using ultraviolet-free light. Based on that evidence, one might support an old myth not to read in poorly lit rooms. More focusing power is required to read in poorly lit rooms and it is the focusing muscle (ciliary body) if placed in overdrive will lead to development of nearsightedness.
Because there is no protective association between indoor sports and myopia, unlike outdoor sports, it suggests that physical activity may be a surrogate for outdoor activity. This is supported by a cohort study with 2 years of follow-up in 156 university students where physical activity time was higher in nonmyopes and associated with hyperopic refraction (0.175 D per hour of physical activity per day; P = 0.015) after adjustment for potential confounders, although there were no differences in objectively measured physical fitness levels between myopes and nonmyopes (P = 0.321).
Get your kids outside and take advantage of the great summer weather! Just don't forget the sunglasses!",http://allaboutyoureyes.blogspot.com/2013/07/
"It's funny how the weather works.
We awoke to a beautiful day. The sun was out of course and there was a slight north wind. The thermometer in my tent registered 50 degrees! It is amazing how warm it can get in the tent even when the outside temperature is so low. As long as the wind is down and the sun is above the horizon by 20 degrees the temperature can really climb in the tent.
As I walked over to the cook tent I looked toward our mountain, Mt. Kirkpatrick, and saw a cloudbank hanging over the area. The problem with clouds on mountains in Antarctica, are they usually mean wind (orographic lifting), and these clouds were lenticular (lens shaped) which means high velocity winds. If you looked carefully at the mountain, you would see that that cloud was part cloud and part blowing snow, this meant that the mission to Kirkpatrick would be scrubbed. Dr. Hammer quickly changed our allotted flight time to take us to the Gordon Valley where he had been before and he knew that we could find some fossil bone. There are some mid Triassic beds that have a lot of bones in clasts so we decided to see what we could do there.
We took off around 9 AM and as soon as we were airborne and climbed to 200 feet we were hit with a pretty big head wind. Normally when we fly to Kirkpatrick, we go 3 at a time because our work zone is near the operational ceiling of the helicopter however, since we were flying on the glacier at about 6,000 feet, we were able to take 6 passengers. This still made for a wild ride as we were buffeted and twisted enroot to the Gordon Glacier because of the up and down drafts coming from the surrounding mountains.
As we approached the landing zone, pilot had to deal with swirling winds and boulders that are scattered all over, so landing the 212 was difficult, and it took several attempts to put the bird down. As soon as we got off the aircraft, we struggled against 40-knot winds to clear our gear from the cargo bay and get a safe distance from the aircraft. As soon as the helicopter departed the area, we took our gear and dropped below a sedimentary structure to get out of the wind, there we regrouped and made our day's plan.
The sediments in the Gordon Valley are from the mid Triassic, and Dr. Hammer had been here before collecting Synapsids so we knew that we would find fossil remains. We fanned out and started searching, when you found bones you would build a stone mound to mark the place then continue on. Next, the sites would be visited by Drs. Hammer and Curie who would determine which were best to remove in the time we would be there. The wind continued to build, and the sun stayed behind a cloud so with the temperatures around 10 degrees F. it was not the most pleasant place to work. I too a walk to the windward side of the plateau and leaned over the ledge (only four feet from the ledge below) and I was able to lean into it and not fall over, it was almost like flying.
With conditions worsening we called for a ride back to camp. We collected several bones, the best being an ulna from a synapsid (type of reptile) that will probably date back around 220 million years. But we did not accomplish a lot today mostly because we were not knocking off our primary goal, which is getting the rest of Cryolophosaurus and exploring other possible fossil bearing strata. As we flew back, we looked towards Mt. Kirkpatrick and we saw it was still engulfed in clouds and swirling winds and at this writing it has not lifted. We can only hope for a better tomorrow and with that, I will close this entry and get some sleep to get ready for whatever tomorrow may bring.
Leaning into the wind!

"This may be a little taboo to say (write?) out loud… but I’m going to say it anyways, because we’re all friends here, right?
Seven years ago, back when my husband and I first started talking about having kids, every time that I would let my thoughts wander and picture myself as a mother – whether I was at the park, walking down the street, or pushing a shopping cart – there was always a baby girl wearing a pretty little dress right there with me. I don’t know why exactly, but I always had this idea in my head that my first born child would be a girl.
We kept the gender a surprise during our first pregnancy. And right up until he came out, I was 100% convinced that the baby I was carrying was my girl. I talked to her, I secretly picked out clothes for her, I mentally put the pink finishing touches on the nursery… It wasn’t until my husband happily announced “It’s a boy – we have a son!” in the delivery room that I allowed the thought of having a baby boy enter into my head and into my heart.
Our second pregnancy, I again secretly wanted to have a girl. Not that I wasn’t completely smitten with my boy – I was… but, there was still that part of me that wanted to be a Mom to a baby girl. This time around we chose to find out our baby’s gender at our 20 week appointment and I admit, there was a small part of me that was disappointed – if only just for a minute – when the tech announced that it would be boy #2 for us.
Today, though, here I am – Mom of two adorable and crazy boys – and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love my boys in a way I never knew possible. They may be a little wild, get a little muddy, and be slightly obsessed with trucks… but, they also give the best hugs, draw me the best pictures, pick me the most perfect dandelions, and best of all – they love me with all their little hearts.
Last week, I had the pleasure of photographing a fresh 48 session for Catherine, Amir, and their now TWO little boys at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. Kamran, who was one of my first newborns back in 2015, is officially a big brother! Witnessing Kamran meet baby Kasra for the first time brought me right back to that day back in December of 2014, when I first saw my son gently kiss the top of his baby brother’s head. That is a moment I am so glad to have captured in a photo, because that was exact moment I knew that I would forever love being a mom to two boys.
Thank you Catherine and Amir for once again choosing me as your newborn photographer. I am so glad to have captured these moments for you!
If you are interested in your own fresh 48 photography session, please contact me, I would love to tell your story!!!

"Radiological worsening of findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) over time were associated with new neuropsychiatric events among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), according to a recent study.
“Neuropsychiatric manifestations occur mostly in the early phases of the SLE course. Nonspecific alterations are evident in conventional brain MRI, regardless of clinically overt neuropsychiatric symptoms,” the researchers said.
In the study, the researchers assessed the prevalence of MRI abnormalities among 44 participants newly diagnosed with SLE, of whom 33 had SLE-associated neuropsychiatric events. They compared white matter lesions and atrophy between participants with SLE with neuropsychiatric symptoms and those with SLE without neuropsychiatric symptoms. In addition, they assessed the impact of MRI changes during follow up and clinical course of neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as used Cox proportional hazard models to compare neuropsychiatric events with MRI data.
Diversity in Lupus Clinical Trials: Why Is It Important?
At baseline, 21 participants (47.73%) had abnormal findings on MRI scans.
Seventeen participants experienced a new neuropsychiatric event during follow up, the researchers noted. They also observed worsening in repeated MRI in 12 participants (27.27%).
In addition, they found worsening MRI was associated with a higher occurrence of new neuropsychiatric events during follow up, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 3.946 (1.175-13.253).

"On January 26, 2016, TapeRelief is pleased to announce the launch of a new wholesale division in the company, which will specialize in providing large quantities of TapeRelief products to gyms, personal trainers, healthcare clinics, and other interested parties. The company wants to make it easier for committed customers to place bulk orders, while exposing new people to this unique product.
For patients and athletes that have to use bandages and tape frequently, adhesives can cause uncomfortable side effects like rashes, blisters, skin irritation, inflammation, skin maceration, and itching, while an allergic reaction to bandage adhesives is common as well. TapeRelief offers a new solution to these nasty side effects, creating an instant barrier between the skin and the adhesive that causes irritation.
""We really believe that TapeRelief will both help your customers and increase your revenue, which makes it a must-have item for any place that goes through a lot of medical or athletic tape,"" says Brook Frank, president of TapeRelief. ""We've found that most people just don't know there's a solution to this problem, which is why we want to see TapeRelief in the gym, the doctor's office, and the drug store shelf. This is the first step towards that goal.""
TapeRelief is applied like a lotion but dries quickly, creating a surface for tape to stick to without irritating the skin. Not only that, but TapeRelief was developed with natural ingredients like tea tree oil, an antibacterial agent that can help prevent infection, and organic oatmeal, which soothes sensitive skin.
Now, TapeRelief wants to expose more people to the advantages of this product by introducing wholesale prices that offer a more than 50% discount to the standard retail price. Starting this February, a Master Case of TapeRelief containing 48 one-ounce tubes will cost just $216.00. That means buyers can receive a tube of TapeRelief for just $4.50, far lower than the retail price of $11.99 per tube.
TapeRelief Sport has also been marked down for wholesale orders, from $359.76 to $156.00, or from a retail price of $14.99 to $6.50 per tube. Additionally, retailers can purchase pallet-sized bulk orders for even larger discounts.
Mr. Frank says that the new wholesale pricing is an ideal solution for healthcare professionals, including medical offices, medical supply stores, physical therapists, amputee supply stores, and holistic medicine companies. He also believes that many fitness companies can benefit as well, and hopes personal trainers, athletic departments, gyms, and other services will take advantage of this new pricing model.
For complete details about the new TapeRelief wholesale division, visit their website at http://www.taperelief.com.
For too long, patients, athletes, and countless others have suffered the nasty side effects of bandages and tape. Skin irritation and contact dermatitis of all varieties are just some of the problems faced by people who frequently cover wounds or protect sensitive skin. Repeated use often leads to rashes, uncomfortable bumps, blisters, irritation, inflammation and itching. Now, there's a solution. TapeRelief creates an instant barrier between the adhesive and the skin, while also soothing the skin and warding off infection with natural antibacterial agents.

"In this article in my NY Times today (the on-line version as I also get a daily delivered hard copy at the front door here in Vancouver, BC) I noticed a photograph taken by Todd Heisler for the NY Times. The article is by Susanne Craig, Jo Becker & Jesse Drucker.
How we perceive colour affects us even if we do not know it is happening. Photographers, artists and media savvy folks know better.
Here in Canada I noticed that the liberal media newspapers (I am a left wing liberal if you must know!) would make our former Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s photographs that appeared in newspapers to be a tad green/cyan. Ugh!
As humans, whose spectrum of colour is decidedly on the red, orange and yellow side (and the reason we get into arguments about blue, green and turquoise and cannot see ultra-violet) we are affected by colour. We see these more visible (the reason fire trucks are red) colours as warm and the others as cool. A green face will never be an attractive one (ask Kermit who will disagree). So if we make a politician’s face in a cool colour we will instantly not like him (her) or at the very least be turned off or not trust.
Much has been written about Trump’s orange face. Perhaps it is a tad. My guess is that Jared Kushner’s shirt is white. I cannot make the same conclusion for Ivanka Trump’s dress. It could be white or even cream.
The photographer obviously did not use a flash and simply shot for existing light. The above pot lights are not balanced for daylight so the camera saw the light as yellowish/red. Either he did not bother to balance the colour correctly (or at least make an attempt with his digital camera's automatic white balance) or the NY Times photo editor did not either, or did not mind.
While I am not a partisan of Trump the man or his policies I do believe that this photograph affects how we perceive the man without us knowing that.
I do not believe in most conspiracies and this is certainly not one. It is just an example of shoddy photojournalism. That my own NY Times is at it too, is embarrassing.
There is a perhaps an apocryphal story here in Vancouver of a wedding photographer who left his rolls of colour negative film at a lab for processing. He did not tell the lab that the bride was wearing a light pink dress. You can imagine the human colour printer attempting to make decent proofs.

"Here we go again. Another new iPhone generation and another wave of battery life complaints rises again. I can clearly remember similar stuff going on around the times the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 4, and the iPhone 3GS were released. But is that supposed to be a consolation?
There’s little official battery troubleshooting info available from Apple and yet, it’s a real problem for a lots of users, as this thread alone in Apple Forums would tell you. Unfortunately, it’s a self-help thread where users try to help each other instead of getting some meaningful feedback from Apple.
I can only guess what’s causing the issues, but the collective wisdom has already produced a nice set of “see if it helps” suggestions. There are a lot of success stores there, so some of the pieces of advice are certainly solid.
The top tip I saw was to restore the iPhone in iTunes the regular way, but without restoring any backups you may have as that would usually carry over software bugs. The second best suggestion is to let the iPhone go through a few battery cycles, meaning letting it drain completely and then charging it up good. My best bet is these two alone would fix most cases of underwhelming battery life.
My iPhone 5 battery life has been less than stellar too, with standby at night eating through the battery a lot faster than my iPhone 4. I’ll certainly give a few of these suggestions a try. I found this post to be a nice starting point.
So how about you, are you happy with your iPhone 5 battery life so far?
This post attracted a lot of controversy regarding our regular battery test. It seems many of you think that since I am complaining of my iPhone 5 battery life, then this shows a flaw in our battery life test, where the iPhone 5 scored a really good combined rating of 51 hours. Well, let me explain why our battery life test is still among the best tools online to compare phone battery endurance.
1. I personally purchased my iPhone out of my own pocket and it has not been part in the making of our iPhone 5 review or the battery test in particular.
2. It’s obvious from my blogpost and from the Apple Forums thread, which I’ve linked, that these battery issues are isolated cases and they do not affect all iPhone 5 users.
3. Our battery tests try to mimic real life usage but as we’ve always said – you should expect the same battery performance “only if you use it for an hour of talking, web browsing and video playback per day.” Everyone has a different usage routine and this is just a sample, a way to get meaningful, comparable numbers out of phones that are essentially quite different.
4. Ultimately, our battery life test is a standardized routine that should allow you to compare the battery life of different devices by different manufacturers when used under identical conditions. Our test does not guarantee you can get the same battery life as we did, as even the cellular network used or the distance to the cell tower may have an impact on battery performance.
What our test allows you to do is compare battery life across different devices in one and the same controlled environment so you can make an informed buying decision.
5. Battery life ratings published by phone manufacturers have always been so far from the reality that many considered them useless – especially standby numbers. Our battery tests are our attempt in achieving realistic and comparable results using a controlled environment with quazi real-life use cases. If you still have your doubts, you may want to go through our How we test article.
When we say the iPhone 5 has a great battery life, we are only comparing it to how other tested devices fared. And truthfully, it turned out pretty good. There is no conspiracy or fanboy-ism at play here. If you are not among the few affected by these battery life issues, your battery life should be as good as that of the Samsung Galaxy SIII, if however, you use it in the same way. Which what we did with both phones in our battery life test.",http://blog.gsmarena.com/does-the-iphone-5-have-issues-with-battery-life/

"Many of you know I’m a constant student in my own journey so I can help you grow into the life you want.
I was instantly struck by the Truth in this statement.
There are way too many people on this planet right now saying they want their lives to change, but unwilling to think or do anything differently to create that change.
Are you one of them? Do you say you want more happiness, or a career you love, or more money in your life?
If so, what are you doing about it?
Are you willing to do something different? Or are you waiting for someone or something to swoop in and rescue you?
Money is a great and timely example here. Many people are learning that they have been entirely dependent on their employer or the economy to feel good about their money situation. If you are someone who only experiences financial prosperity when all of the economic conditions cooperate perfectly, you are one of those people!
So what might you have to do to finally gain control over your financial situation?
You might need to think new thoughts that will help you create what you want.
You might have to release old beliefs that are keeping you stuck.
You might need to replace old beliefs with ones that will help you create prosperity no matter what economists, the media, and your neighbors tell you.
You might need to study the Truths about money and the Laws it follows.
You might need to leave the “security” of the job that is limiting your income potential.
You might need to change your people environment.
You might need to get control of your emotions.
You might need to use your time and energy differently than you are now.
You might need to invest in yourself at a time when others are pulling back in fear.
The Truth is, if you truly want something you don’t have right now, you also have the opportunity to create it. And that opportunity will require you to change something that you’re doing. But most people will insist on doing things the same way and wishing for different results.

Take a look around you. You want something in your life to change, and you have been presented with an opportunity to do that. An opportunity or resource has presented itself to you that will require a new behavior on your part. It might even require you to use your time or money differently than you have in the past.
Consciously decide if you want to make the change or stay stuck with your current situation.
Act on your decision!

"Irina Reyn’s Mother Country begins in the middle of a complex history: Nadia Borodinskaya, a single mother, has been working tirelessly in the United States for the last seven years to bring her adult-aged daughter, Larisska, from war-torn Ukraine. Larisska, nine when her mother begins the immigration process, is twenty-one when they find out Nadia alone has been approved to move to the U.S. Because Larisska is now a legal adult, she’ll have to reapply. Nadia’s decision to leave her daughter for the U.S. drives a rift between them—Larisska feels abandoned by her mother, while Nadia feels leaving Ukraine is the only way she can eventually give Larisska a better life.
Reyn weaves throughout Nadia’s story a compelling perspective on twenty-first century motherhood that ricochets between East and West. In moving between Rubizhne and Brooklyn, between Nadia’s active mothering of Larisska and her desire to be a mother from afar, between her past in Ukraine and the jobs she holds in the U.S.—as the nanny of a child and the caregiver of an elderly man—Nadia’s motherhood unfolds. Readers discover a fiercely protective woman who has torn herself in half by leaving her daughter in the mother country she aches for.
Nadia’s focus on the horrors back home often leave her in awe of Western problems. Early in the novel she obsessively checks Skype to see if her daughter is alive after heavy fighting breaks out in her home region. In stark contrast, Regina, the mother of the child Nadia nannies for and who leans heavily on Nadia for support, has a meltdown when trying to select a theme for Sasha’s fourth birthday party. Nadia is surprised: “Sasha was safe and happy and loved. Why was this not enough?” While Regina insists that mothering consists of giving children ample choices—Sasha must be allowed to choose her food and activities—Nadia’s reality is a choice-less one.
Unlike Regina, who folds in on herself at the slightest problem, Nadia is hyper-aware of all events related to Ukraine. She watches the news regularly and keeps up with anyone who might have information on the situation in the country. While she pities Regina her fragility, however, Nadia also wants to protect Regina from her all-consuming suffering: “And how could Regina possibly know her daily, pressing, constant palpitating fear? This was the one thing she owned, an emotion native to her, the one that gave her strength and resources Regina was lucky enough to lack.” This strength also allows Nadia to accept Larisska’s resentment, and even her accusation: “You left me. You had a choice and you left me alone here.” Though the words hurt, Nadia’s desire for their reunification is stronger.
The most important relationship in this book, then, is between mother and daughter. Because physical and psychic separation exist between Nadia and Larisska through the bulk of the novel, a sense of loneliness permeates the narrative. It is clear that the men in Nadia’s life have been either inconsistent or absent—her father died when she was four months old, and Larisska’s father was a married man with whom Nadia worked at a factory in Rubizhne (as a result, he spent little time in his daughter’s life). It is also revealed that when Nadia was thirteen, her sister’s college friend raped her—something that, while traumatic, Nadia felt was not completely unexpected: “She was sure this happened to all girls, a normal turn into adulthood, as necessary as vaccination.” The only constant, the only source of stability, in Nadia’s adult life, then, has been her role as a mother, and her daughter. In America, readers see Nadia grasping at this relationship. Her separation from beloved people and places, as well as the way in which Reyn bookends the novel with a news report about a twenty-seven-year-old woman (revealed to be Larisska) who lives through bloodshed in Ukraine, allows readers to feel the rawness of Nadia’s reality—her daughter is in danger and there is nothing Nadia can do.
It is this loneliness and the ways that the patterns of Nadia’s own life begin to play out in Larisska’s that make reconciliation between mother and daughter possible. Nadia decides to visit her daughter in Moscow a year before Larisska is able to immigrate to the U.S; though their reunion is initially strained, Nadia has stayed close to Larisska in spirit. Throughout the novel, readers are immersed in Nadia’s memories of the life she and Larisska had in the Ukraine—Reyn masterfully draws readers into the constancy of memory throughout the novel, making Ukraine and moments of Nadia’s past life just as present to Nadia as her daily life and work. For Nadia, the beauty of her daughter and her beloved Rubizhne are unmatched; and yet, both her country and her relationship with her daughter are fractured by conflict.
It is in Moscow that Nadia realizes the threat posed by her mother country.  Early in the novel, readers discover that Nadia desires harmony—that all sides “could talk to each other, come together peacefully to find a way forward for a united Ukraine that served west and east.” This is what she seems to wish for herself and Larisska, too. As the novel progresses, Nadia realizes life cannot return to how it was before the war, before she left her daughter. And yet, her mothering instinct drives Nadia’s desire to reclaim her child from her devastated city: “Now she understood Rubizhne was sewn inside her. She came from a small city in a country that others have used, divided, abandoned, plundered. The faster she ripped her daughter out of their mother country, the better.” But Larisska cannot come to the U.S. yet, which continues to frustrate Nadia. As much as Nadia hopes for a reestablishment of the relationship between herself and Larisska, it is clear that any relationship they are able to have will be significantly different from when Larisska was an adolescent.
When Larisska is finally able to come to the U.S., the first thing Nadia notices is the new shape of her daughter’s body. Larisska is pregnant—a fact that ties Nadia and Larisska together as single mothers, and provides the necessary starting point for their new relationship. As she imagines this new life with her daughter in America, Nadia realizes that growth will take time: “It would be everyone getting to know each other again, feeling gingerly around the new, redrawn borders of their love.” Though Nadia will now have to be a mother to Larisska in new ways, her overwhelming feeling is one of peace: “All that mattered was the breathing body between her arms, and now, amazingly, the breathing body inside that body. It was unharmed and it had the capacity to love.” Ultimately, Mother Country is a history of a mother’s indomitable love, and the ability to, on a personal level, make peace. Though fighting over geographical borders may continue, Nadia will continue to nourish the relationship with her daughter until it is healed and whole again.

"Chinese authorities in Wuhan Thursday said that they will conduct door-to-door home searches for people potentially infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and corral the sick into massive, makeshift quarantine camps around the city, according to a report in the New York Times.
The desperate situation in Wuhan is clear from the latest outbreak figures. Of the 31,530 reported cases of 2019-nCoV in over two dozen countries, 22,112 are confirmed in the Hubei province alone. And of the 638 deaths logged so far in the outbreak, 618 have occurred in the province.
A secretive startup that promotes a massive international universal facial recognition database seeded from more than three billion images is facing pushback from tech firms as it tries to woo more law enforcement agencies.
The company, called Clearview AI, went from near-complete obscurity to national headlines following a report published by the New York Times in January. The Times described Clearview as a ""groundbreaking"" facial recognition service. A user imports a photo of a person, and then the app shows ""public photos of that person, along with links to where those photos appeared,"" the NYT explains.
Clearview claims to have agreements with 600 law enforcement agencies for use of its services, and the company says it has a set of three billion public photos to match new images against. Those photos come from a wide array of sources, and the sources are ticked off.
A 19-year-old man named Tyler Wallace is in police custody after he entered a Walmart last Sunday in the Chicago suburb of Joliet. He walked through the store wearing a mask and sign that said ""I have the coronavirus."" He sprayed Lysol on produce, clothing, and other products. According to the Chicago Tribune, he faces charges of disorderly conduct, retail theft, and criminal trespass to property.
A 17-year-old friend who accompanied Wallace in the store is also facing charges of disorderly conduct and criminal trespass. His case will be handled by juvenile courts.
Police don't believe that either teen is actually infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
Enlarge / Surviving these dark caves is about to get a whole lot easier, if you want it to be.
The Capy Games' survival-focused dungeon-crawler Below has earned a well-deserved reputation for punishing difficulty—Rock Paper Shotgun used it as a prototypical example of the necessary industry niche for ""ultra-hard games."" But the coming console release of the game will be introducing a new ""Explore"" mode that completely does away with this game-defining difficulty.
While the original game will still be available as ""Survival"" mode, the new Explore mode is ""tuned to be accessible for players who seek more of an action-adventure style of play,"" as Capy put it in an announcement. In-game mechanics like survival, death, and damage will be toned down to be more forgiving, so players can ""lose themselves on The Isle without suffering the exquisite pain of Below's original design.""
""EXPLORE mode is our way of answering everyone who played BELOW at launch and found the challenge a bit too steep,"" Capy's Kris Piotrowski said in a statement. ""It was clear that many players were intrigued by the game's haunting underworld and rich atmosphere, but its difficulty made the game inaccessible to some. We hope to see new players to get into Below, and for seasoned players to revisit The Isle and enjoy the game in a whole new way.""
The ransomware in this case is RobbinHood, known for taking down the city of Baltimore networks and systems in Greenville, North Carolina. When networks aren’t protected by robust end-point defenses, RobbinHood can easily encrypt sensitive files once a vulnerability has allowed the malware to gain a toehold. For networks that are better fortified, the ransomware has a harder time.
Now, RobbinHood has found a way to defeat those defenses. In two recent attacks, researchers from security firm Sophos said, the ransomware has used its access to a targeted machine to install a driver, from Taiwan-based motherboard manufacturer Gigabyte, that has a known vulnerability in it. Despite the vulnerability that led to the driver being deprecated, it retains the cryptographic signature required for it to run in the highly sensitive Windows region known as the Kernel.
According to a report from CNBC, ViacomCBS is planning the launch of a new streaming service that would expand upon the already successful CBS All Access with films from Paramount Studios and Miramax, plus TV programs from networks like MTV and Comedy Central.
The news follows a high-profile merger between Viacom and CBS. CBS had already launched its CBS All Access service before serious movement on the merger began, and Showtime (also owned by ViacomCBS) has offered streaming options for a while now. Previously, Viacom offered some streaming services of its own while also licensing its content to bigger players like Amazon Prime Video. Both CBS All Access and Viacom's existing streaming services would continue to exist alongside this new service in the company's current plans.
The future TV landscape is looking increasingly clear: an à la carte selection of major media companies' individual libraries, with a streaming service for each company. Disney recently launched its own service called Disney+ to early success, and WarnerMedia has begun pulling its properties like the popular sitcom Friends from other streaming services as it prepares to launch its own offering.
The phrase ""warm summer evenings"" sounds like an offer of a lazy, peaceful, relaxing respite. Any peace, however, will almost certainly be temporary, interrupted by an annoying buzz that signals it's time to start swatting away and, if that doesn't work, spend the rest of the night scratching some itchy welts.
By the time you hear its buzz, the mosquito has already engaged in a multisensory program that started by picking up your scent and the increased levels of carbon dioxide coming from your breath. 
Interfering with this multisensory program holds the potential to not only improve your enjoyment of summer evenings; it could play a major role in limiting a variety of insect borne diseases that collectively kill millions of people each year and exact a staggering toll beyond that. But to interfere with the system, we have to understand it. And a key step toward that has now been provided by the identification of the protein that lets the mosquito sense that we're warmer than the environment. Unfortunately, that knowledge has enabled us to confirm that wiping out the heat-sensing part of the system is unlikely to protect us.
Customers of a small cable company in Vermont are protesting the company's pending sale to Comcast.
The sale of Southern Vermont Cable Co. (SVCC), which has about 2,450 subscribers and operates 123 miles of cable, is being reviewed by the Vermont Public Utility Commission. The commission has received 25 public comments, all of them either opposing the sale or expressing concerns that it will be bad for customers without appropriate consumer-protection measures.
Southern Vermont Cable owner and president Ernest Scialabba founded SVCC in 1988. He is selling the company and plans to retire after spending more than 40 years in the cable industry. Comcast already provides service in neighboring areas.
After essentially flat sales in 2019, (most of) the auto industry came to Chicago this week for the first big auto show of the year. In terms of making headlines, the 2020 Chicago show is yet more proof that the days of the big trade show are almost at an end as OEMs increasingly opt for standalone events to premiere new products. Two laps of the McCormick Place convention center was more than sufficient to take it all in, and while there was little new, a clear trend was evident. Efficiency, electrification, or advanced safety systems mostly took a back seat to size, with monster-faced SUVs and trucks everywhere I cared to look. As a harbinger of things to come, I dare say there was even a sense of menace lurking in the shadows.
Arguably the biggest product news of the week—albeit one of little interest to most of this audience—was the launch of Cadillac's newest Escalade. But that took place in California earlier in the week, and the biggest, brashest, body-on-frame behemoth didn't show its bluff nose (or anything else) in the Windy City. The closely related Suburban and Denali (and their full-size pickup cousins) were out in force, and I'm not being dramatic when I say some of them felt physically threatening to stand next to even when they were stationary. I'm 5' 7"" (1.7m) tall, and some of the hoods are now level with my shoulders, which is a recipe for vast, child-swallowing blindspots in front of their drivers. At a time when pedestrian safety is headed in the wrong direction, one has to wonder how we can get this pendulum to swing the other way.
The United States Space Force, the newest branch of the US military hewn from the Department of Defense's space-focused units under instructions from President Donald Trump, has a lot to do in order to establish itself. Among other things, the service's leadership needs to decide what to call its members and each of its ranks (which, unlike ""airman"" and ""seaman,"" needs to be gender neutral).
- What should the enlisted E1-E9 ranks in the Space Force be called? Must be gender neutral.
- What should the collective group of members serving in the Space Force be called? Some names floating around already are Guardians, Sentinels, and Vanguards. Feel free to create a brand new word for those who are linguistically inclined.
CMSgt Mitchell also asked for input on enlisted rank insignia, uniforms (""all black with white nametapes,"" one forum member responded), and other key elements of a ""Space Force culture.""
It's been a long time coming, but it's finally here. I'm talking about Locke and Key, the highly anticipated adaptation of the award-winning comic book series of the same name, written by Joe Hill and illustrated by Gabe Rodriguez. And yes, fellow uber-fans, it was worth the wait. The series boasts strong writing, pacing, performances, and above all, it looks amazing, bringing the fabled Keyhouse and the darkly fantastical world of the comics to vivid life.
We've had to swallow our disappointment again and again over the years, since it proved notoriously difficult to get any adaptation off the ground. The project (in various iterations) bounced from Dreamworks and 20th Century Fox, to Universal and then Hulu, before finally landing at Netflix. That proved to be the perfect match. ""I think this is the story in the best possible version,"" Hill said at a pre-release press event that also included Rodriguez and show runners Carlton Cuse (Lost) and Meredith Averill (Haunting of Hill House). He compared the various adaptation attempts to turning a combination lock and waiting to hear it click. ""This time it clicked.""

CUNA spokesperson Vicky Christner told Whittaker that “CUNA does not store Social Security numbers or credit card numbers of our members"" and that ""there no evidence to suggest that any data in our system—such as names, businesses addresses and email addresses—have been accessed.""
So, just how durable is the new Moto Razr? Motorola's nostalgic, folding-display flip phone has a number of unproven features that, after the public failure of the Galaxy Fold, every potential customer should be concerned about. Evidence is starting to pile up that the Razr might be another delicate foldable that isn't up to the task of day-to-day smartphone usage.
In addition to the same display durability issues that the Galaxy Fold had—an OLED display that has to deal with both the stress of bending and an easily damageable plastic display coating—the Razr has a trick hinge system that is a lot more complicated than that of the Galaxy Fold. In an effort to keep the display from creasing deeply, Motorola says the Razr hinge ""includes moveable support plates that rigidly support the display when the phone is open but collapse out of the way when the phone is closed."" There have been a few sources now that suggest this hinge design isn't going to last.
The first piece of evidence comes from CNET, which just wrapped up a torture test of the Moto Razr with disappointing results. CNET got ahold of SquareTrade's Foldbot, a robot designed to open and close folding smartphones repeatedly until they die. The Galaxy Fold survived the Foldbot for 120,000 folds before the fatigue from bending destroyed the display. CNET was hoping the Razr would last for a similar 100,000-fold torture test, but Moto's phone only lasted for about a quarter of that time. After 27,000 folds, the hinge mechanism jammed up, and the phone wouldn't close anymore.
The Federal Communications Commission has defeated another challenge to its repeal of net neutrality rules, as a federal court yesterday decided that it won't rehear the case.
In October 2019, a three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the FCC's repeal of net neutrality rules. Mozilla, consumer-advocacy groups, and state attorneys general asked for a rehearing in front of all the DC Circuit court judges, but the request was denied yesterday in a very short ruling.
The petitioners could still appeal to the US Supreme Court but haven't said if they will do so. ""While today's result is unfortunate, it's not that surprising,"" Free Press VP of Policy and General Counsel Matt Wood said. ""Courts routinely deny rehearing requests like this. But we'll keep weighing our legal options.""
Update (Feb. 7, 2020): A Steam version of Metro Exodus is now due for release on Feb. 15, precisely one year after it appeared as one of the first big-name exclusives on the Epic Games Store. Other high-profile games launched exclusively on the Epic Games Store last year seem likely to follow suit throughout 2020.
Epic Games and Deep Silver announced today that the PC version of Metro Exodus will be downloadable exclusively through Epic's recently launched Game Store starting February 15.
This week, India's Ministry of Defense is holding Defexpo 2020 in the northern part of the country. The event seeks to promote India as a ""defense manufacturing hub."" In other words, it is essentially an arms bazaar.
One of the main exhibits of this week's show is a large display showing off a copy of the hardware used during Mission Shakti, the successful anti-satellite test conducted by India in March, 2019. During this test, the country successfully fired a missile from the ground to shoot down a satellite at an altitude of 300km.
The country's prime minister, Narendra Modi, characterized the test as a critical one for his nation, saying, ""It shows the remarkable dexterity of India’s outstanding scientists and the success of our space program."" Effectively, Modi was saying that India had arrived as a global space power. After the United States, Russia, and China, India became only the fourth nation to shoot down a satellite.
It's been a positive enough trajectory to set the table for this week's stellar Birds of Prey, which appears to benefit from the DC powers-that-be telling its writer, director, and crew to go completely nuts. This bombastic, hypercolor explosion of filmmaking is exactly what the comic-film industry needs: equal parts slapdash and artfully arranged, designed to please anyone who wants more depth and weight in a ""light,"" humor-focused comic film. I went into its screening expecting a killer performance from Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, which came true. I left surprised and stunned by the rest of the film's bloody, candy-colored pieces falling into place around her performance.
I shaved my what for this?
Let's start with the film's easiest point of praise. DC Comics' Bronx-accented scoundrel Harley Quinn steps out of the shadow of her usual criminal-clown boyfriend, and the results, in Robbie's nimble hands, rank at the top of the modern comic-film acting pantheon. Unlike her performance in Suicide Squad, where the character wavered between ""lead"" and ""sidekick"" status, her return in BoP enjoys a front-and-center placement, which the actor relishes.
The days leading up to Valentine's Day can be stressful. The Hallmark holiday sneaks up on us after the collective hangover from the winter holidays finally disappears—before you realize the tinsel's been tucked away, you're scrambling to buy flowers, chocolates, jewelry, and the like. But instead of spending money on expensive gifts that your partner may only enjoy for a finite amount of time, we at Ars want to encourage you to spend quality time together—and what better way to do that than to pick up the joysticks and play some video games?
While there's a lot of emphasis in the video game community on online multiplayer and the ease of being able to play with friends regardless of your location, it's always fun to share the experience with the person you love most while being literally right next to them on your own couch. Below we've gathered some of our favorite couch co-op games, which span across platforms and range from hardcore to beginner-friendly. They should allow seasoned and less experienced gamers alike to spend a couple hours this Valentine's Day vacuuming up ghosts, preparing meals, battling underground monsters, defusing bombs, and racing to the finish line. Regardless of your skill level or game of choice, the time should be more special because you're spending it together (aw).
Luigi's Mansion 3 tasks Mario's sheepish little brother with rescuing his friends from the clutches of a haunted hotel. Its two-player mode doesn't become available until an hour or so into the story, but at that point the rest of the game becomes one of the most accessible co-op campaigns in recent memory.
Uber announced on Thursday that it lost $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. As I said last quarter, this wasn't a surprise. After all, Uber lost $1 billion in the first quarter of 2019, a lot more than $1 billion in the second quarter (though most of it was one-time charges related to Uber's IPO), and $1.1 billion last quarter. Uber has been burning cash at about this rate since at least 2017.
The losses might seem endless, but CEO Dara Khosrowshahi says that the end is actually in sight. The company previously said it was aiming for profitability in 2021. In a Thursday conference call with investors, Khosrowshahi said that Uber was actually on track to turn a profit even earlier: by the fourth quarter of this year.
Could Uber really reach profitability so quickly after years of 10-figure quarterly losses? Uber management has always argued that the situation was temporary—that big losses were driving Uber's rapid growth and would turn into profits once Uber's growth leveled out.",http://brianbarrett.net/aggregator?page=31

"Assured Site site visitors- going immense amounts of speedy visitors to your web page is fundamental! Inside the Site targeted visitors generation business, there's a adage that goes considerably like ""website traffic is king."" When you undoubtedly understand, as a way to generate merchandise income It's important to get certain Web page website traffic. Let's be honest, employing the whole world-wide-Internet... the only real process to get sales is to get certain Internet site targeted traffic. How?

You can not simply hold your breath then hope that someone will unintentionally stumble on in your Internet site, Regardless how stupendous it might be.
A to some degree exceptional strategy to crank out quick site visitors can be to have already got a connection from an additional Website of your own personal, or any individual else's Web page.
The one quandary about this selection could well be... so that you can get prospective customers to your site, initial there must be guests likely to These other web sites. Another time, it necessitates advertising.
Accordingly, free of charge traffic to my Site may well be The trail to accomplishment, but marketing may be the road for getting certain Site visitors! Consequently let us have a brief dialogue regarding internet web page promoting up coming...
Site promoting is assisted, the truth is it's pushed by the search engines. The upper you rank on the research browser, the greater surfers who can come upon and pay a visit to the web site.

"We couldn’t be happier with the home that Bunting Construction built for us in Palmetto Dunes! When we decided to tear down our old home and rebuild we were faced with a number of challenges, not least of which was distance. Living about 700 miles away, we needed a builder we could trust and who understood our vision for our house. We interviewed five reputable builders, but Scott stood out. His enthusiasm, attention to detail and commitment to quality became quickly obvious to us. We toured several homes he built and were very impressed. Coincidentally, he had built a home for an acquaintance of ours, and this individual confirmed our impressions.
Fun is not necessarily a word you would use when describing the building process but Scott made the whole experience enjoyable. He understands the needs of the out-of-town owner. Being able to follow the construction of your home by monitoring his website is fantastic. We became addicted to checking out the photos! Scott really kept them up to date and rarely did a few days go by without more pictures being posted. Scott was very responsive throughout; emails were returned within minutes! When we came down to see things first-hand, Scott devoted his weekends to us. He knows how to navigate the ARB, his subcontractors are top-quality and he keeps his construction site tidy.
In summary, we couldn’t recommend Scott enough! Rest assured, you’ll end up with a quality home from a builder who takes pride in his work and will stand by it. Further, he’ll make the process enjoyable, and you may even get a few trips on his boat! We had so much fun, we’re thinking of building another.
""As we looked at and considered several of the top ranked builders on Hilton Head Island to build our ""Custom One of a Kind"" Beach Front Home it became apparent to us that Scott was our choice given the examples we were shown and more so the techniques and craftsmanship that would go into our home. The top builders often use some of the same subcontractors and we found the real differentiator to be the ""project management"" that Scott brings to the project in first himself and his manager who's on site during the process assuring the attention to detail and follow through to make the experience and outcome truly ""Custom""... for example we wanted to construct a home that will stand up and face a Category ""four"" hurricane....from the foundation to the roof and he was the only one that was willing to take that on and bring in the expertise to accomplish it within costs parameters that others could not accomplish or were willing to put such a guarantee in place.
When all was said and done folks like the Hilton Head construction Inspections group asked for permission to bring their staff through our home as it was truly one of a kind and without question the ""finest home on the island'....many others contractors and suppliers on the project has stated the same and the awards that Bunting Company has received speak for themselves....additionally the insurance and financial appraisers have all stated that local comparable homes are simply not available and the closest is in ""Old Palm Beach""... just recently we had visitors from Christie's Estate Real Estate visit our home and they labeled it ""The finest Home in the Low Country""... suspect you've gotten the impression we (I) am crazy about our home and that is correct. We are equally crazy about Scott Bunting and his finished product and more importantly the manner in which he lives with his projects after the sale and take care of his homes as if they are his.... In a big sense they are and that separates Scott from the others.
“We love this house.” That is what my husband and I say every time we arrive at our Sea Pines home. This is our third year in the house and we are still saying it!
Four years ago, we explored the possibility of renovating. Living 950 miles away and knowing nothing about building a house, what could have been an overwhelming process was not because of Scott and his team. Scott immediately understood the type of house we wanted – a modern retro beach cottage.
Scott stayed on our timeline and budget, but just as important he made the entire process fun. His attention to the smallest detail was amazing. We are still fascinated by his creative use of materials. When you live so far away you have just trust your builder to make good decisions for you. Because Scott took the time to really get to know us, we always trusted him to make those decisions. Scott takes personal care to make sure the worksite is safe tidy and as unobtrusive to neighbors as possible. His subs are equally considerate. We are thrilled with our home and had fun working with Scott. We couldn’t recommend Scott and Bunting Construction Company any more highly.

"The copy room here at the church serves as an ad hoc lunch room for staff. We cover a lot of conversational ground in there. Family, trends, politics, travel, nutrition, theology, pets…you name it, we talk about it. Last week, slang came up. Well, honestly, I brought it up after making a comment earlier in the day to a younger gym rat at the end of a workout who responded with a really odd look. The look was so odd that I wondered if I’d said something unintentionally inappropriate. I went home, looked it up, and was relieved to find that his confusion was because I’d been obtuse, not obscene. You don’t have to hang out with me very long to know that I enjoy good words whether they’re super old and out of use or fresh and new on the scene. The problem is that I have trouble keeping up with slang which creates confusion from time-to-time. So when the words “peace out” popped into my head in response to today’s Bible reading, I searched them online before throwing them in the sermon. Thank God, we’re good. But you need to let me know if I somehow missed a memo. Maybe it’s because of growing up in 1980s California, but saying “peace out” with the requisite double fist bump over the heart and peace sign comes second nature to me. It’s the kind of thing that takes conscious effort not to do although it still regularly slips through the cracks of adulting.
“Peace out” (yes, fist bump and peace sign, too) is what comes to mind this week especially after last week’s Bible reading. The one in which Jesus rebuked James and John for wanting to rain fire down on the Samaritans. In the story today, 70 additional disciples are running around Samaria with the good news of Jesus. They’re supposed to announce peace by saying, “Peace to this house!” If their peace is received, the disciples can stay and receive hospitality from the people there. If not, peace out – wiping off the dust of the town from their feet in protest. Peace in. Peace out.
What does “peace in” look like for us? How can we tell when someone is announcing peace to us? This may be a good move to make as we think about announcing peace ourselves. It doesn’t seem to be about like-mindedness. By like-mindedness, I mean people who just give us the thumbs up on our latest cockamamie scheme or ill-conceived opinion because they’re similarly motivated. Rather, I wonder if “peace in” looks like a truth contrary to our current opinion. In the Bible story, the disciples are vulnerable in a potentially hostile environment. In verse three, Jesus tells them that he is sending them “out like lambs into the midst of wolves” without purse, bag, or extra sandals. Peace is what they carry. Peace in. On a personal level, peace as contrary truth to our current opinion could look like where Jesus meets the dark place in ourselves that we think is unredeemable. The dark place in ourselves that makes it hard to hear other people. The dark place from where our attacks on other people are subconsciously launched from. When I’m with someone who announces this kind of peace, their lack of judgment is a gift as I wrestle with the darkness at hand. The acceptance and love of Jesus is both honest and compassionate about my humanity on display.
Notice in the Bible story that Jesus is not asking the disciples to assess the house or its occupants.[1] There’s no wondering about whether the people in the house have kept the law or worship the same God or will be worth it to the disciples’ overall work in the long run. They are to simply announce peace to the whole house. Peace in. Jesus’ instructions rely on the assumption that the disciples have peace.[2] Jesus says, “…your peace will rest on that person.” He identifies that the disciples’ peace is something they already possess. More than just an ability to stay calm, they have God’s peace, God’s shalom, in themselves which gives them confidence in God’s presence with other people too.
As Christians we practice this kind of peace during worship when we share the peace before communion. We embody reconciliation with each other as we announce peace to each other with a word of peace. When we share the peace in a few minutes, enjoy this moment as the disciples must have also done, confident in the presence of God within you and in each one of us. From sharing the peace this morning, take the peace out into your interactions this week. How will you announce peace? As with Jesus’ disciples, there is nothing lost when we announce peace. Think about the peaceful presence of other people who may not share the same perspective but are willing to engage with people as a sacred act – fully and peacefully present. This peace looks really different than the people who treat others as objects on which they act, as others less worthy than themselves. The disciples share peace and are assured that they lose absolutely nothing if it’s not received. The world would be a different place if we acted out of that confidence. But it takes practice. Like the old adage, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Trying again is part of the freedom of our baptism, my friends.
Unlike last week when James and John wanted to blast those who rejected them off the face of the planet, Jesus prepares the new disciples with a plan for when they’re rejected. He gives them an action to take knowing that they will be rejected. The translation today uses the word “protest.” Jesus gives them the action of peaceful protest. Life and limb is preserved while the response to the rejection takes the form of dust. The power of peace in the powder falling from their shoes.
The peace the disciples share is also a prophetic peace. “The Kingdom of God is near” regardless of whether or not their peace is received. This is the same kingdom sung about by Jesus’ mother Mary in her Magnificat found in the first chapter of Luke.[3] Mary celebrates the kingdom that scatters the proud, brings down the powerful, lifts the lowly, and feeds the hungry. Again, not a peace that is about calm so much as it is about the confidence that God is present in the tension when the Kingdom of God comes near.
May we be ever confident in the peace of God that passes all understanding as we peacefully protest, announcing the peace that is promised for everyone, and that is promised for you.[4] Peace out.

"Pope Paul VI by his motu proprio Ingravescentem aetatem, dated November 21, 1970, substantially modified the electoral power of the cardinals. The document stipulated that cardinals older than eighty years were deprived of their right to elect the pope and to participate in the conclave. When this provision went into effect on January 1, 1971, twenty-five cardinals lost their electoral rights. This regulation was later reaffirmed by his apostolic constitution Romano Pontifici eligendo of October 1, 1975 and by Pope John Paul II's apostolic constitution Universi Dominici Gregis of February 22, 1996.
As of February 25, 2020, there are 123 cardinal electors from 66 countries. In parentheses following the name is the year of cardinalitial creation.

"As a woman, getting licensed to carry your own firearm is an effective way to feel more secure when you're outside of your home and alone. Whereas self-defense items such as pepper spray can also be valuable, there's no greater security than having a firearm within reach — and nothing else that will make a would-be attacker reconsider his idea extremely quickly. When it comes to keeping your handgun concealed, how you dress and the type of holster that you buy and wear are important. Because you can't allow your firearm and holster to be in plain sight when you're in public, here are some different holster options to consider.
Many women favor smaller handguns, which makes wearing an ankle holster ideal. Most ankle holsters are designed for firearms that are small in size and have limited-capacity magazines. An ankle holster can be ideal with certain types of attire. Obviously, you won't be able to wear such a holster with short skirts or dresses, nor with leggings or tight pants. However, if you wear loose-cut pants or pants that flare at the ankle, an ankle holster will be perfect for subtly strapping to your body and carrying your firearm without anyone paying attention.
Fanny packs may have been a punchline a few years ago, but more and more women are carrying fanny pack-style purses and bags when they travel. Unlike a purse that could possible be snatched off the shoulder, a fanny pack is held securely against the body and a coat or long shirt can easily cover it. This type of holster is ideal if your firearm is a little too large to fit in an ankle holster, or if you want to have quicker access to the weapon. For example, if you park in an intimidating parking garage, you can easily unzip the holster and walk with your hand inside it until you're safely in your vehicle.
A bra holster is a suitable choice for women who wish to have their sidearm close at hand, especially if it's small. With a bra holster, the gun typically sits horizontally just below the breasts, meaning that you'd be able to easily access it by undoing a button in a blouse and reaching inside or quickly putting your hand under your sweater. This holster is best suited for bulky attire so that the gun remains invisible to those around you, but can be a perfect choice for women who wish to carry a firearm.

"We are so brainwashed by centralized models of state authority that few can even imagine a system where the solution is not one centralized monstrosity ruled by a political/financial Aristocracy but a competing profusion of opt-in, transparent solutions.
Many readers ask me for solutions to the current arrangement's many ills. Seeking solutions is a healthy and positive direction, for highlighting what's broken is not only much easier than proposing solutions, it's a dead-end. Pointing out what's broken is only the first step in crafting solutions.
But I've noticed that what most people want is not a real solution--they simply want what's easy, which means leaving the Status Quo in place but magically making it cheaper and more convenient for them. If the solution requires inconvenience, getting less, accepting more responsibility and making major trade-offs--then it can't be a solution because politicos have overpromised for so many decades that people expect everything to get cheaper (for them, not the system) and easier (for them, not the system).
For example, I proposed a simple solution to the unsustainably costly U.S. healthcare system: The ""Impossible"" Healthcare Solution: Go Back to Cash(July 29, 2009).
This solution would definitely lower costs and impose discipline on patients and providers alike--and for that reason, it is seen as ""impossible,"" because the last thing patients and cartels/state agencies want is discipline that forces hard choices and rigorous changes in behavior, diet, fitness habits, etc.
Broadly speaking, the first step in any healthcare solution is to radically reduce preventable diseases that result from lifestyle choices by making patients responsible for the consequences and costs of their lifestyle choices.
The next step is to make the real costs of treatment and coverage transparent, so people--patients and citizens-- can see the real costs and make decisions based on the limits of cost, effectiveness, etc.
Both of these steps are absolute anathema in the current system.
Nobody likes any of the practical solutions because everyone wants unlimited care and unlimited choice. Expectations in a system where the government can just borrow another $1+ trillion to pay the bills are unrealistically high, and the feedback from reality, i.e. price, has been eliminated in the current cartel/state-fiefdom system.
Everyone talks about ""reform,"" but real reform is impossible in a bought-and-paid-for ""democracy"" like ours: Why Reform Won't Work (February 7, 2013).
Even more profoundly, the Central State and ObamaCare are the wrong unit size to provide healthcare that is transparently priced, accountable to the consumer, adaptable and decentralized.
Rather than a single top-down system, we need dozens of transparent opt-in choices.
Centralized, top-down systems are quickly stripped of innovation and cost control as the political and financial Aristocracy soon capture the regulatory and governance machinery for their own benefit.
As I noted in The Pareto Economy (February 18, 2013), 80% of the benefits could be reaped for 20% of the money squandered on our corrupt, fraudulent, ossified centralized systems.
A good first step would be to admit to ourselves that we don't really want solutions; what we want is magic: financial magic that makes healthcare free and affordable, medical magic that fixes all our lifestyle ills without forcing any rigorous adult routines and limits on us, political magic that transforms our system from its current corrupt crony-capitalist paradise into a functioning, transparent democracy and economic magic that makes all the unpayable debt vanish so we can borrow another $50 trillion, or $100 trillion, with no restraints on our spending or cronyist corruption.
I have no idea what it will take to jolt us from our preference for magic over realistic, difficult (i.e. adult) solutions, but I suspect a crisis that threatens to completely unravel the Status Quo will be part of the process.

"300 Competitors. $50,000. Three throws...
And an excuse to get out of Mom and Dad's basement.
The 2006 USARPS Championships - that's the USA Rock Paper Scissors League for those of you not familiar with the acronym.
Should I repeat that? Rock, Paper, Scissors. Rock, Paper, freakin' Scissors.
This man, from Nebraska, won $50,000 for winning a glorified game of Rochambeau. You can insert your own jokes, I'm too busy stocking my pantry with bottled water, batteries and canned goods because, clearly, this is the sign of the Apocalypse.
If rock-paper-scissors is, in fact, the next Texas Hold'em (in terms of payout) or the next cool game that all the kids are playin' (like Dodge Ball) then what comes after RPS? I know that somewhere there's some MIT drop-out sitting at his coffee table thinking of another way to stick it to his overbearing father by inventing yet another way to fuel his Red Bull habit by doing anything but joining the working week.
A little more involved than RPS, but any guy (or girl, don't want to generalize) who was a regular D&D player in, ahem, High School who still has his Mom do his laundry and make his lunch should be able to tackle this contest with little problem. Though it can be physical, so a player should be immediately disqualified if they regularly had a nurse's note to get them out of gym class.
Again, this one involves a bit of athletic ability, but I think any psychotic fan of Star Wars who spent 48 hours standing in line for the release of the Phantom Menace without proper access to a rest room could probably handle it.
Oops, wait a minute... I think this one has already been done. Its commonly called Minor League Baseball.
I envision this one as a larger version of ""Beauty and the Geek"". Something tells me there wouldn't be as much tagging when the women were ""it"".
The caffeine is starting to wear off, so please feel free to add your own. I think we might have a new career in the making here.
I totally need to invent a game to get me out of the work week. Mind if I borrow one of yours?
Dude, I am all about a Red Rover Championship! It'll be in the X-Games for sure!
Hide & Seek - With hidden cameras in the compound to see where everyone is hiding. Another ultimate reality TV show in the making.
Old Maid/Go Fish - These card games have got to be as interesting as Poker.
How about Dodgeball? 1,2,3 greenlight? Simon Says?
My hubby actually is in an Italian ""morra"" tournament every year(a game of throwing fingers simultaneously against an opponent and saying the sum in Italian) The winner only receives a trophy....
Freeze Tag - you know you loved that one as a kid. No other game exposed elementary school favoritism better than this one. ""Hmmm ... do I save Brian or Mike?""
Battleship - all together now ""You sank my Battleship!""
Pin the Tail on the Donkey - blindfolds, thumb tacks and an Ass ... wait, is this to be held in Vegas? Don't they already call that the Porn convention?
Spin the Bottle - the ultimate game of self elimination ""no way am I kissing him/her … I’m out""
Tic-Tac-Toe - even a Super computer named WOPPER proved that this game is unwinnable ... hehehe ... Matthew Broderick '80s movie references ... good times!
and of course ... the ultimate game of chance ... coin flipping ... not to be confused with cow tipping, which too might make a good competition.
Well, there are already competitions for Battleship. They're played every year at the Origins gaming convention.
Back to the days of recess... Chinese skipping or maybe a good round of marbles.
For us mom's we could have stroller races which involve maneuvering a double stroller through a busy grocery store. That's always a challenge! I just know it's a sport and I'm in training.
Hooray for Four-Square! I freakin' rocked at that game growing up...I knew how to double-bounce without being called for ""typewriting"".
 Some people are just wired for that. And by the look of it they also drive tractors for a living...
Mother May I? Hide and seek was the other one but someone smarter already took it.
I'm not lying - I have a T-shirt from the world RPS society. I'll take a photo and put it up on my blog but I've been down with the RPS championships for years.  I'd be the mo-fo champion, I've been training for years.
Ha! What about thumb wrestling?  I am all over a four-square championship.

"I've been thinking of getting the Devi DVD for my wife - your high opinion of her just pushed me closer.
I've heard you speak of breaking a freeze by acting--but this is the first I've heard that that first attack will always be tentative.
Whoa. That's news to me, and it suggests to me that any plan/training for reacting to an attack and trying to break a freeze should include more than one action. Is that workable, or is one action--that trained reflex you've talked about--all you can really hope to prepare?
Two separate issues. the Oc response (conditioned reflex) ideally will kick in before the freeze. the big value is that because it is unexpected, it tends to disrupt the bad guy's plan and force him into a freeze, too, leveling the playing field.
What seems to work to break the freeze is 2 actions. Not sure why, but it seems pretty consistent. What I can't know is if just explaining it is enough for people to do it or remember to do it under stress.
All that stuff is in the next book.
Well, if it takes two actions to break the freeze, maybe this is why. That first tentative response is a test. ""Did it make things worse?""
 If not, you hit him again because now you have a _new_ strategy of the it-hasn't-killed-me-yet variety to fixate on.
It seems to me that the ideas and strategies that you here ascribe to predators can be put to use for more socially positive ends.
That is, isn't this how you would try to control a prisoner as a corrections officer? Or how you would try to talk down a drunk? - Keep them in their social brain?
A drill based on Rory' s reception line and rear attack drills: line, eyes closed, instructors in back with focus mitts. Student gets tapped on the back of the head, pivots and ROLLING THUNDER, maybe 5-8 hits. Instructor moves with advance. Pt 2: smack w/instructor kiai to create startle; at ransom times; same. This is JKA variant where the sense carried a shinai around. Creates a more 'global' awareness during point-of-action focus and closing the""perception-action gap"".
""an unsolicited promise is always a lie""
One thought: Women know that men are stronger than they are and that (all else being equal) in a physical fight, the man will inflict more damage on the woman than she will on him.
The thought process goes something like this: He is holding me.He is stronger than I am. Therefore, I am not strong enough to get away from him. If I try and fail, he will hurt me. He can hurt me more than I can hurt him, therefore I cannot hurt him enough to make him let me go. Because he is stronger than I am and he can hurt me much worse than I can hurt him.
Buried in there somewhere is the assumption that his motivation to keep her is as strong as her motivation to get away. If that were the case, her logic would hold true, I think. I do not think, however, that it is true.
It seems that their use of words is important - the implication that there are only 2 ways for this to go.
I remember reading that this ploy of giving only 2 options is a standard technique of coersion.
""Do this, or I'll hurt you"".
Or ""You want this (easy/no punishment)? Or that (punishment)""? It can work just as well with ""If you do this I won't hurt you"" - implying the opposite as option #2.
For some reason, we are easily led by words, and narrowing the imagination as to what options exist (pain/ no pain) seems like a common method of control.
I think we also key on the words used. Working construction, you learn to say to people ""Make sure you step over that extension cord"" not ""don't trip over that cord"". Turns out more people trip when you say 'trip'.
Rory, you say ""the most common attack"" of men on women involves a weapon. Are you sure you're remembering that correctly?
I just spent a while rummaging through the NIJ's sponsored research paper website and the material we used for a review article some years back. For the overwhelming majority of sexual assault, most simple assaults and a plurality of robberies there is no weapon according to multiple sources and methodologies (police reports, reported summary statistics, victim interviews, and others).
That said, the point you're getting at is well taken.
The hardest thing in teaching basic self defense to women was getting some of them past the ""That isn't nice"" or ""But I might hurt him"" stage. It's the default socialization for girls. It can be quite a job getting them to the point where it's OK to tear a guy's head off and beat him to a pulp with it, no matter how terrible he's being.
Yes, Irene, men are generally bigger and stronger than men. There's more going on than that. We aren't where we were sixty years ago, thank the gods. Women are still taught to be deferential to men, to apologize more (you referenced that a while back), to take up less space, to be quieter and so many other things.
I'm a guy. I like to use cars as an analogy. Go too fast, you get in an accident. Go too slow, you get in an accident. Guys are more likely to be above the speed limit here or at least think they are before the reality checks start bouncing. Gals are more likely to need instruction that gets them up to highway speeds.
Not always, but often enough that there's a definite pattern.
RJ Nash's research was from the UK. It was the only breakdown of assaults by type that I've seen. His description, as well as I can recall it, is 'the threat displayed a weapon, made a threat and then escorted the woman away with a hand on her upper arm.' I believe the condition black article is available on line.
That actually makes a lot of sense, especially if it was from a few years ago. We see the joys of the intersection of politics and policing.
When I used to follow the literature on this sort of thing the UK seemed a little weird. There was a lower sexual assault rate than in other Western countries during periods lasting quite a few years. And more of it was with violence.
A lot of it was what the police classified as sexual assault. Home Office and local police doctrine for quite a while was to provide a hostile, confrontational interrogation.
For the victim.
Unless there was a weapon or really exuberant violence a woman who went to the police was in for an experience not unlike the original assault. And - this is just anecdotal from advocates and cops, but still worth noting - it discouraged women from reporting at all. Classification bias, sample bias, you name it bias.
Let's throw it into an even harsher light. By the same standard there's pretty much no rape in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan or Somalia. There are practically no reports and even fewer convictions. Maybe Wahabism makes men respect women. Or maybe it has something to do with the required three male witnesses to the act for a conviction.  Women have been stoned as adulteresses in several of these countries for going to the police.
Given that I'm a little skeptical. Given that rape involving a weapon is much rarer in similar countries like Canada, NZ and Australia I'm a lot skeptical. And given that it's much lower in the US where firearms are much more common I'm very skeptical.
That doesn't do anything to invalidate your point about what needs to be done. Changing people's minds so they react in productive ways to criminal violence is the one really important thing.",http://chirontraining.blogspot.com/2010/10/synthesis.html
"Abstract: Le duel qui oppose le président sortant Moncef Marzouki à l'ancien chef de gouvernement Béji Caïd Essebsi dans le cadre du second tour de la présidentielle, prévu le 21 décembre 2014, révèle les lignes de fracture de la société tunisienne que les élites politiques croyaient avoir résorbées grâce à leur sens du consensus et du compromis. La cartographie électorale des législatives et du premier tour montre une Tunisie divisée entre un Nord en grande partie pro-Essebsi et son parti Nida Tounes, et un Sud majoritairement pro-Marzouki et favorable au parti islamiste An-Nahda. Afin d'éviter que les craintes réciproques finissent par conduire à des violences, le vainqueur de ce premier scrutin présidentiel libre et concurrentiel devra d'abord reconnaitre les inquiétudes de l'électorat du vaincu. Pouvoir exécutif et législatif devront s'engager de concert à traiter la question du déséquilibre régional et prévenir les risques de blocage institutionnel ou de répression des oppositions.
Abstract: Something is brewing in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. It is not so much that protests have been spreading since 2011; the country has experienced these before and so far they remain relatively small. It is, rather, who is behind them and from where dissatisfaction stems. East Bankers – Jordanians who inhabited the area before the arrival of the first Palestinian refugees in 1948 – have long formed the pillar of support for a regime that played on their fears concerning the Palestinian-origin majority. That pillar is showing cracks. The authorities retain several assets: popular anxiety about instability; U.S. and Gulf Arab political and material support; and persistent intercommunal divisions within the opposition. But in a fast-changing region, they would be reckless to assume they can avoid both far-reaching change and turmoil. Ultimately, they must either undertake the former one or experience the latter.
Abstract: Since it assumed power after Hosni Mubarak's ouster, the performance of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) has been, at times, head-scratching. Extolled in the wake of the uprising as the revolution's protector, many have come to view it as an agent of the counter-revolution. It often has been obstinate, before abruptly yielding to pressure. It values its long ties with Washington, from which it receives much assistance, but seemed willing to jeopardise them by targeting U.S.-funded NGOs. Suspected by Islamists of seeking to deprive them of opportunity to govern and by non-Islamists of entering a secret pact with the Muslim Brotherhood, it finds itself in the worst of both worlds: an angry tug-of-war with liberal protesters and a high-wire contest with Islamists. It displays little interest in governing, wishing instead to protect privileges, but erratic behaviour threatens even that. On the eve of presidential elections that have become a high-stakes free-for-all, the SCAF should take a step back and, with the full range of political actors, agree on principles for a genuine and safe political transition.
Abstract: Dans un contexte arabe marqué par des transitions bâclées ou sanglantes, la Tunisie fait encore figure d'exception. Depuis le 14 janvier 2011, ce n'est pas seulement la tête de l'ancien régime, symbolisé par l'ancien président Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, qui est tombée. C'est tout un système qui se trouve bouleversé, principalement dans le cadre d'un consensus relativement large. Mais les défis qui pourraient menacer ces progrès existent. Parmi ceux-ci, deux en particulier sont étroitement liés : restaurer la sécurité et mener une véritable lutte contre l'impunité. Pour le nouveau gouvernement d'union, dénommé Troïka et emmené par le mouvement islamiste An-Nahda, la clé demeure dans un dialogue large, permettant de réformer les forces de sécurité sans trop les provoquer, rendre justice aux victimes de la dictature sans céder à la chasse aux sorcières, et garantir une justice efficace tout en tenant compte des limites du système judiciaire en place.
Abstract: At a distance, Syria's conflict can resemble a slow, painful slog, punctuated by intermittent accelerations and apparent tipping points, influenced by international activity. Zoom in, and one can cast such impressions aside. Diplomatic manoeuvrings have ended up being little more than inertia masquerading as motion. The West used them to pretend it was doing more than it was; Russia exploited them to feign it backed the Syrian regime less than it actually did. Meanwhile, in Syria, one sees neither deadlock nor abrupt transformation; virtually everything has been changing but at a steady pace: the shape of the conflict; civil society dynamics; sectarian relations; and the very nature of the regime the opposition seeks to depose.
Abstract: Even before the popular wave from Tunisia and Egypt reached Yemen, President Saleh's regime faced daunting challenges. In the north, it is battling the Huthi rebellion, in the south, an ever-growing secessionist movement. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is showing mounting signs of activism. Sanaa's political class is locked in a two-year battle over electoral and constitutional reforms; behind the scenes, a fierce competition for post-Saleh spoils is underway. Economic conditions for average Yemenis are dire and worsening. Now this. There is fear the protest movement could push the country to the brink and unleash broad civil strife. But it also could, and should, be a wake-up call, a catalyst for swift, far-reaching reforms leading to genuine power-sharing and accountable, representative institutions. The opposition, reformist ruling party members and civil society activists will have to work boldly together to make it happen. The international community's role is to promote national dialogue, prioritise political and economic development aid and ensure security aid is not used to suppress opposition.
Abstract: The Syrian uprising has defied conventional expectations and patterns established elsewhere in the region from the outset. It happened, first of all, and to many that in itself was surprising enough. The regime was not alone in believing in a form of Syrian exceptionalism that would shield it from serious popular unrest. Once the uprising began, it did not develop quickly, as in Egypt or Tunisia. Although it did not remain peaceful, it did not descend into a violent civil war, as in Libya, or sectarian affair, as in Bahrain. To this day, the outcome remains in doubt. Demonstrations have been growing in impressive fashion but have yet to attain critical mass. Regime support has been declining as the security services' brutality has intensified, but many constituents still prefer the status quo to an uncertain and potentially chaotic future. What is clear, however, is the degree to which a wide array of social groups, many once pillars of the regime, have turned against it and how relations between state and society have been forever altered.
Abstract: As a rule, Iraq's post-Saddam elections have tended to magnify pre-existing negative trends. The parliamentary polls to be held on 7 March are no exception. The focus on electoral politics is good, no doubt, but the run-up has highlighted deep-seated problems that threaten the fragile recovery: recurring election-related violence; ethnic tensions over Kirkuk; the re-emergence of sectarianism; and blatant political manipulation of state institutions. The most egregious development was the decision to disqualify over 500 candidates, a dangerous, arbitrary step lacking due process, yet endorsed by the Shiite ruling parties. Under normal circumstances, that alone might have sufficed to discredit the elections. But these are not normal circumstances, and for the sake of Iraq's stability, the elections must go on. At a minimum, however, the international community should ramp up its electoral monitoring and define clear red lines that need to be respected if the results are to be considered legitimate. And it should press the next government to seriously tackle the issue – long-neglected yet never more critical – of national reconciliation.
Abstract: On 31 January, Iraqis will head to the polls in fourteen of eighteen governorates to elect new provincial councils. The stakes are considerable. Whereas the January 2005 elections helped put Iraq on the path to all-out civil war, these polls could represent another, far more peaceful turning point. They will serve several important objectives: refreshing local governance; testing the strength of various parties; and serving as a bellwether for nationwide political trends. In several governorates, new parties or parties that failed to run four years ago may oust, or at least reduce the dominance of, a handful of dominant parties whose rule has been marred by pervasive mismanagement and corruption. This in itself would be a positive change with far-reaching consequences as the nation braces for parliamentary elections later in 2009.
11. Iraq's Kurds: Toward an Historic Compromise?
Abstract: The removal of the Ba'ath regime in 2003 opened a Pandora's box of long-suppressed aspirations, none as potentially explosive as the Kurds' demand, expressed publicly and with growing impatience, for wide-ranging autonomy in a region of their own, including the oil- rich governorate of Kirkuk. If mismanaged, the Kurdish question could fatally undermine the political transition and lead to renewed violence. Kurdish leaders need to speak more candidly with their followers about the compromises they privately acknowledge are required, and the international community needs to work more proactively to help seal the historic deal.
Abstract: Navigating the treacherous shoals of the Iraq conflict with a steady hand, Jordan appears to have emerged unscathed from the turbulent months just past. The Hashemite Kingdom adjusted its rhetoric to fit the public mood while backing U.S. policy in Iraq and in the Israeli-Palestinian struggle, managed to overcome its principal weaknesses and now faces the post-war world with renewed confidence and authority.
Abstract: Eight weeks after victoriously entering Baghdad, American forces are in a race against the clock. If they are unable to restore both personal security and public services and establish a better rapport with Iraqis before the blistering heat of summer sets in, there is a genuine risk that serious trouble will break out. That would make it difficult for genuine political reforms to take hold, and the political liberation from the Saddam Hussein dictatorship would then become for a majority of the country's citizens a true foreign occupation. With all eyes in the Middle East focused on Iraq, the coming weeks and months will be critical for shaping regional perceptions of the U.S. as well.

Abstract Background Arthritis rheumatoid (RA) is certainly a chronic autoimmune disease seen as a irritation and joint rigidity, resulting in tissues destruction finally. Connective tissue development factor (CTGF) is certainly a critical element in RA development, which promotes fibroblast-like synoviocyte Zetia small molecule kinase inhibitor (FLS) proliferation, pannus development, as well as the harm of cartilage aswell as bone tissue. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) can promote irritation resolution in severe inflammatory illnesses, and recently, ramifications of RvD1 on chronic inflammatory illnesses attracted interest also. This research directed to examine the result of RvD1 on pannus development in RA as well as the root mechanism. Strategies Serum degrees of RvD1 and CTGF were decided Zetia small molecule kinase inhibitor in RA patients and healthy persons by UPLC-MS/MS and ELISA respectively. The levels of CTGF and inflammatory factors were assessed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. MicroRNA expression profile was determined by miRNA microarray. The effects of CTGF, RvD1, and miR-146a-5p on angiogenesis were evaluated with tube formation and chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assays. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were constructed to detect the effects of RvD1 and miR146a-5p on RA. STAT3 activation was determined by Western blotting. Results RvD1 levels decreased while CTGF levels increased in RA patients serum, and an inverse correlation of the concentrations of RvD1 and CTGF in the serum of RA patients was synchronously observed. In CIA mice, RvD1 suppressed angiopoiesis and decreased the expression of CTGF. Simultaneously, RvD1 significantly decreased CTGF and pro-inflammation cytokines levels in RA FLS. Furthermore, CTGF suppressed angiopoiesis and RvD1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of RA FLS and angiopoiesis. MiRNA microarray and qRT-PCR results showed that RvD1 upregulated miRNA-146a-5p. The transfection experiments exhibited that miRNA-146a-5p could decrease inflammatory factors and CTGF levels. Moreover, miRNA-146a-5p decreased the proliferation of FLS and angiogenesis in vivo. MiRNA-146a-5p also suppressed angiogenesis and downregulated the expression of CTGF in CIA mice. Finally, Western blot results revealed that miRNA-146a-5p inhibited the activation of STAT3. Conclusion RvD1 is prone to alleviate RA progression through the upregulation of miRNA-146a-5p to suppress the expression of CTGF and inflammatory Zetia small molecule kinase inhibitor mediators, thereby decreasing pannus formation and cartilage damage.

One-way analysis of variance test was applied to analyze the differences among multigroups. Results RvD1 levels decreased while CTGF levels increased in serum of RA patients The concentrations of CTGF and RvD1 in RA patients and the health controls were decided. As depicted in Fig.?1, serum RvD1 levels in RA individual were 26.34?pg/ml (95% confidence interval [CI] Itgam 22.55C30.14?pg/ml), that have been significantly less than those in regular people (38.09?pg/ml, 95% CI 32.69C43.48?pg/ml) (Fig.?1c). On the other hand, serum CTGF amounts in RA sufferers (123.5?pg/ml, 95%CWe 94.08C152.84?pg/ml) were remarkably greater than those in regular people (81.14?pg/ml, 95% CI 68.24C94.04?pg/ml) (Fig.?1d). Furthermore, an inverse relationship from the concentrations of CTGF and RvD1 in serum was noticed with check was used to judge the statistical significance between your regular and RA group RvD1 attenuated joint parts harm and inflammatory response in CIA mice To verify the result of RvD1 in the development of RA, we treated CIA mice with RvD1 (0, 20, and 100?ng). The consequence of the mean scientific scores demonstrated that there is no factor between your low-dose group as well as the high-dose group (check was used to judge the statistical significance Suppression aftereffect of upregulation of miR-146a-5p and downregulation of CTGF on angiogenesis The consequences of miRNA-146a-5p and CTGF in the angiogenesis had been detected by pipe formation and CAM assays.

I have to go to a nursery committee meeting where I know they are going to try and make me be treasurer and I'll be too weak willed to say no.
Tuesday always seems to be a day of competitive morning thread making.
What Calpol does Ronnie get - the strawberry flavoured one for really young kids (delicious) or the banana flavoured one older kids (bleurgh)? I could do with some, I have a cough which keeps getting worse in the evenings and reaches its peak when I try to sleep. What's with that?
i thought the older kids one was orange?
either way it pales in comparison to the purple one.
So rank, you couldn't actually tell what it was.
Either way, strawberry wins (and I used it for years because I refused to swallow pills. Think I'd still prefer the Calpol to be honest).
think it must be to do with lungs lying down? or airways or womething, try bit of Olbas or taking cough mix before bed?
I keep thinking it'll be gone by tomorrow, I don't need your Western medicine, but it's been like four nights now.
the responsibility! the politics! the pressure!
if i let the little'un anywhere near DiS my posts would end up looking like when Chintzy comes on here drunk.
When I was helping pack for my family holiday this year a load of tramadol fell out of my dad's suitcase.
Think he'd been stashing it. Bit worrying.
needed it or something more worrying? was just reading up on it on wikipedia when I was finally had a little hand-eye coordination, and I can understand, if one was that way inclined, it could be very addictive indeed .
He's had chronic neck pain for a couple of years now and has gone through various therapies/treatments/medications.
I think tramadol is now his standard 'if it hurts a lot today, take one of these'. I don't think he's actually stashing it, he's just absent minded and probably accumulates packs of it. He's running the London Marathon next year, maybe he's getting a supply ready for that.
also looked into getting my visa photos for India, they want these odd size dimensioned pictures which cost more, why do they have to be so difficult!
Gap yahs don't come easily, you have to EARN them.

um... that's it.
Sounds good. I desperately need a new laptop. My current one is six years old and unable to download any new updates, while constantly telling me there is no space yet. Don't even know where to start looking for a new one. Might get a netbook or something, but I still want a DVD drive.

If you pretend to be a duck people might feed you bread and stuff.
Upon skim reading I thought that said people might breed you and stuff.
No one in their right mind would do this.
Where did you get a Sara Lee from?
THought they were instinct. Bloody loved Sara Lee chocolate gateux.
Yesterday I told work I'd make them an apple sponge pudding (someone brought in cooking apples) and I did make it except I got greedy and ate most of it before going to bed. It started off as ~I'll just make sure it tastes ok~ and shaving a bit of the end but but before I knew it more than half the cake had gone :( No one has mentioned it yet. Hoping they've forgotten.
It wasn't actually Sara Lee, but it seemed pretty much identical, I'd wager they were made in the same factory.
I got it from Spar. It was my favourite childhood food. 
Use to have it every sunday after roast dinner. There was a brief period where my mum would buy the party size version. Those were good days, if somewhat troublesome for my childsized stomach.
Yes! I'd always have it at my grandma's house after a Sunday lunch.
Stop co-opting my childhood.
why do they always clean the toilets at the exact time of the morning you need a shit?
I used to know a girl called Sara Lee.
She's married now, she isn't called that any longer. Shame, there were billions of cake shouts before that.
I'm going to see TTSS tonight I think, maybe something to eat too. It's a bit of a busy week I haven't really factored in sleep time.
He has a cup of tea, though, so at least he has his priorities sorted.

I got a text this morning, perked me right up it did.
We need an internet name for her.
I think meo called her church girl.
So...that would make her CG...
Can't see any potential confusion there.
She texts in American?
and said you perfect except for the fact you live in different countries?
Ill tell you mine, if you tell me yours...
I wanted to not post here for a bit because it was kinda wrecking my work rate, but I've failed massively. At least I didn't announce it or anything.
Happy to hear about the new girl, HYG. Sorry to hear about the job, Chintz.
give them my number, yeah? Cheers.
But you would totally hate it.
OH GOD. SO HERE'S YOUR FUTURE.
I know this one guy who was out of work for like two years, and now he has a lovely job. You can cope with that, right?
 I think I'm just going to do it. And think only of clothes, shoes and holidays.
Around next week or so Ima try and book a holiday on a publishing wage, so we can do my analogous pity-party thread then...
I try that sometimes.
Never works. Just trust your natural intelligence will allow you to pull it all off.

View Full Version : How often do you give fresh hay?
Just wondered really as Timmy and Blossom only seem to eat like troopers when it is strong smelling fresh hay. We give them some everyday but should we be giving fresh stuff at the same time we give them their other food and water (2/3 times a day)??
I give mine some morning and evening, as they definitely tuck in more when it's 'fresh'.
I change my bunnies hay every day. They only eat the long stalky bits and will only eat it when it is fresh so I throw away the old stuff and give them new every morning.
For the foster bun, who is outside, the same as the my indoor pair - they all get treated the same!
fresh litter tray each morning. then new hay at 6pm when i get in, then more hay at bed time.. if i come home at lunch time they get a handful then too.
I manage to top mine up in the morning with breakfast, and in the evening when I clean them out.
i guess i could do it twice a day, usually top up in the mornings!
Deej must get his done about 3 or 4 times a day. As he's an indoor bun and he loves his hay, we just do it whenever we pass by and see that he could do with another handful.
me too. they have 'fancy' hays (anything not simple meadow, i tend to mix up fancies for extra fun, and throw in any treat hays or dried dandelion) in their hay basket, but they also have meadow hay to snuggle in and some more to reach for. they never finish their hay but they do eat a lot!
Morning and evening, along with their pellets.
Three or four times a day, and they get three of four different types of hay to keep them interested.
not nearly as much as Nemesis, my male Holland lop.
stuff the next morning.
I add fresh hay 3 or 4 times a day. They always have lots of hay available but it seems to taste nicer when it's just been put down.
But, oddly, they seem to go mad for the stuff that's in the dirty litter tray from the day before if they get to it before I empty it too. :?:?",http://forums.rabbitrehome.org.uk/archive/index.php/t-213591.html?s=e94b9a94b0ee01a302b5a52aedc5aafe

"99 STX 1100 Nose Heavy with 1 person. Any way to adjust trim on jet?
Thread: 99 STX 1100 Nose Heavy with 1 person. Any way to adjust trim on jet?
Hello again Hulk friends... I have a 1999 STX 1100 It has a tendency to want to sit front heavy and shovel water over the front especially when I go through the channels in no wake zones. Is there a way around that? Could the Jet possibly be off the correct angle? I leave a pretty big wake when going slow too like at 1500 RPM because the nose dips down and scoops the water over it. I have 2, 3 to 5 minute no wake zones I need to go through to get to the main lake where I ride, and there isn't any way around it. I have to go slower then everyone else when there is traffic to not make a wake, and I'm still pushing more of a wake then the big boats. I keep maybe 5 lbs in the front with my cooler bag, and stuff when I go out.. I did compensate by putting a 10lb anchor in the back seat compartment but that doesn't really make a difference. Its great with 2 people on it though. Seems like its best suited for 2 up riding actually. It does plane out quickly buy it will case the waves hard when going fast like a belly flop. Otherwise I tend to sit way back towards the second seat when I am going fast, and it helps a little more..Wish it had trim adjustment, or a way to get just a little more trim on this thing. I am a 220lb rider if that matters. Also there is no leaks, and the jetski does not take on water so there isn't the issue of water weight in the hull. Any way to get around these issues?
Could my jet somehow be not in the right position, or is here a way to adjust it?
I just read that the trim plate can be shimmed?
Thank you for your responses guys, and gals. You all have been very helpful so far since I have joined and I greatly enjoy and appreciate your help.

You might look into a pump wedge if it's that bad.
That body style STX does tend to plow water with the nose at trolling speed.
Thanks for the responses guys.. I ended up coming across a post where a guy use a Kawasaki ZXI 750 900 pump wedge and it worked great. It's supposed to gain a few extra Mph and correct the shoveling issue at low speed as well as help the total ride. I found one on ebay that the guy was selling with the jet and got him to seperate it for 20 dollars. I believe that the inside of the pump wedge needs to be grinded down a few mm to be flush with the opening on the 1100 from what he says. Shouldn't be that bad to do..
I seriously doubt that you'll see a difference. I've never noticed a difference with changing trim while at no-wake speed.

The release is full of pretty holiday and winter themed products I know you are going love. Everything will be available for purchase beginning at 10 PM EDT on September 22th!
My first two projects are created with the Springs & Sprays: Holiday Stamp Set and Dies and the Vase Collection 4 Stamp Set and Die. This are two of my very favorite products from the new release. The vase die cuts a slit in the top of the vase to add the foliage. I added a few pinecones. and greenery at the bottom of the vase and centered the vase on a circle die cut with the Love to Layer: Scalloped Circle Die from Bitty Big: Pure Poppy Color Collection.
 I added twine around the center of card to add to the rustic feel. The sentiment is from the previously released Just Sentiments: Warmth.
My second card is also created with the Springs & Sprays: Holiday Stamp Set and Dies and the Vase Collection 4 Stamp Set and Die but this time I went for more of a winter feel. I stamped the grain of the wood on the vase in Versamark Ink and embossed with white embossing powder. The snowflakes are part of the From Our Home to Yours Stamp Set and Dies released last month.
I cut a frame with the Border Bling: Skinny Stitched Frame Die. Behind the frame I added vellum and a sheet of patterned paper. The sentiment if part of the new Just Sentiments: Snow Stamp Set and die cut with the Charming Tags 1 Die.
Next up is a look at the new Into the Blooms: Poinsettias Die and another pretty sentiment from the Just Sentiments: Snow Stamp Set. I die cut the flowers from Sweet Blush Cardstock and the sprayed the flowers with Tim Holtz Mica Spray.

"Alan Parker, Kenneth Branagh and assorted British film people wrote an open letter to the Times warning that piracy is undermining the creative industries. On the radio yesterday I heard the producer of Quantum of Solace stating how in the far east they don't make any money on DVD sales because everyone watches illegal copies. He bemoaned all the promotion and distribution costs they have to bear.
Sigh. They still really don't get it do they? They have one model which they keep returning to, again and again. They're supposed to be creative, so get creative about your own industry. Interestingly, they put forward the opposite argument back in the 1980s when home video first came on the scene. Then the argument was that it would detract from cinema revenue and result in the collapse of the film industry. Then they realised that they could make as much, if not more, money from video rentals and sales and now they see it as some hallowed right to retain. Just as they were slow to understand the potential for home video so they are being slow to appreciate what the online world offers. Their only response to the internet at the moment is to think of it as another distribution medium – DVD online, for the same fee.
So, if any executives want to hire me on an expensive consultancy, here is my seven stage plan for what they should do.
Accept the inevitable, don't fight it. When content becomes digital it will be freely distributed online. It's not as if they haven't had enough advance warning from the music industry about this. So don't waste your energy in trying to invent ever more restrictive DRM (which some teenager will hack the following week), or more aggressive legislation (which alienates your audience and can never be fully effective), or putting political pressure on Governments (who understand the issue even less than you do). Instead put your effort into finding a workable solution in the new landscape.
Look at some of those costs. Distribution? Packaging? They're going to disappear. Marketing? Will need to be redirected. Actors? Well, maybe they are demanding $20million per picture because they know the profits you are making. If you're making less, they'll get less. A lot of your current costs are based on your current model – the model shouldn't exist just to justify these costs.
Be the iTunes of film. Develop a super- cool, massive bandwidth, good social interaction site with a huge database.
Make downloads or streaming cheap enough that some people will pay over downloading pirates eg. $1 a film.
Use advertising. Make downloads free, but with some obligatory, can't be skipped adverts at the start.
Offer subscription service which gives extra functionality – commentaries, webcasts from the crew, sneak previews, invites to pre-screening, etc.
Make the cinema the experience – films still have the cinema as their main source of revenue. This is not a zero-sum game: A lot of people who download a film have either already seen it in the cinema, or wouldn't go and see it there anyway. Not every download is a cinema seat lost. Cinema going is still a social activity (what else would teenagers do on first dates?), and they should utilise this even more than they do currently.
Games consoles have taken to new models quite well and report some success. Both Xbox 360 and PS3 offer film rentals through downloads, and some films you can buy there.
Interestingly, and not coincidentally, both formats have switched to a ‘Second Life’-style virtual environment. In the PS3 version you and your avatar can go and watch movies in the virtual cinema (there are only trailers at the moment, but movies are expected). Here, the online world attempts to succeed by approximating the ‘real’ world. Strange business, eh?
I think films there are relatively pricey still, but then I’m a cheapskate (who used http://www.someecards.com for all his Christmas cards this year).
If the majors think I or other people are going to pay such a price to go to the cinema so they pay their actors milions of dollars they can think again. This is my explanation of why less and less people go to the cinema!
Great post and all good points, but Know real viable model being offered or provided that’s going to put filmmakers first and pay the filmmakers first, and yes pay-per-view streaming video should be cheaper. But for right now somebody has to pay for the stream, and if the content is good enough I think people will pay 2 to 3 bucks to see a great indie film on your big screen tv, and if you like it enough you might even purchase the DVD just to say you own it. There is one working model that http://fansoffilm.com offers, I think if filmmakers and fans got behind would change everything. One that does put filmmakers first, and the filmmakers makes all the profits. Fans Of Film is a site that uses high quality paypal streaming video that filmmakers manage just like a YouTube account in a Ning social setting. Really Fans Of Film is taking what indiegogo.com has done, but taking to the level of actual distribution. Even though Fans Of Film is only a mouth old and still in the development and designing stage, Fans Of Film is making waves on twitter and already has some films.
really a nice post .

The Grinnell study, published by the American Journal of Infection Control, looked at the effect of using copper on commonly-used pieces of equipment, including four types of weights (dumbbells, barbells, kettlebells, specialty dumbbells) and three types of attachments (grips, lat pulldowns, low-rows).
Staphylococcus was the most common type of bacteria found on surfaces that the research team tested. In recent years a virulent form of this bacteria, MRSA, was discovered to have infected players in professional, collegiate and secondary school team sports. Athletic facilities at Villanova, Purdue, Bellarmine and others are now using weights made with CuVerro® copper to help ensure athlete health.
The study found that dumbbells were by the far the “dirtiest” pieces of equipment tested at the new Grinnell College Fitness Center, a popular health facility for students, athletes, and faculty in Grinnell, Iowa.
“Our study highlights the ability of athletic surfaces to serve as reservoirs of bacteria,” according to Associate Professor of Biology Dr. Shannon M. Hinsa-Leasure, who led the research. Copper’s ability to kill bacteria1 24/7 is “useful for continuous hygiene maintenance”.
“Using copper alloys on high touch surfaces combined with other standard cleaning procedures could help lessen the spread of infection,” she said.
The Fitness Center research is the second major study on copper surfaces conducted by Hinsa-Leasure and her team at Grinnell’s Department of Biology. The weights in the study were provided by Black Iron Strength® made with CuVerro antimicrobial copper.

Our international environment is fast paced, that puts talent acquisition high on the agenda. Many of our hiring managers have first handedly experienced the benefits of our hiring principles. You will thus join an environment that is open to hire the talent of tomorrow. We expect you to scale this philosophy and the processes in our entire company, with every new hiring manager and interviewer.
We opted for a decentral organization structure, with big emphasis on customer centricity and autonomous teams. Once you know your way around all stakeholders, you can move fast and with big impact.
Since we are growing fast, career opportunities tend to evolve quite rapidly, but we would like to grow together: current possible career paths in HR are towards a talent manager role or towards a HR bp role in plants or customer teams.

"Recently, the Astrophysical Journal published the latest numerical work on the particle acceleration. Dr. LI Yan from Yunnan Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and his cooperators investigate the acceleration process of charged particles in the turbulent magnetic reconnection current sheet, and give some new results of particle acceleration.
Solar flare is the most violent energy release process in the solar atmosphere. Observations show that high-energy non-thermal particles account for 10% - 50% of the released energy. The induced electric field generated by magnetic reconnecting current sheet is an effective mechanism to accelerate high-energy particles. However, long current sheet is usually unstable and highly turbulent, which will produce various plasma instabilities, most notably the formation and merger of magnetic islands. The motion of charged particles in this electromagnetic field structure is very complex, and the details of acceleration are still unclear.
Researchers performed 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of magnetic reconnection taking place in the coronal current sheet, and obtain the self-consistent electromagnetic field at different times, with high spatial resolution and time cadence. Then, researchers looked into the motion of electrons and protons and studied in detail the dynamics of both particles via the test-particle approach.
Their results show that the energy spectra of protons and electrons that possess a single power-law shape were deduced for various phases of the magnetic reconnection process. The evolution of the spectrum shows a soft-hard-soft pattern that has been observed in flares.
For the motion of the magnetic island, it yields the occurrence of the opposite electric field at both endpoints of the island; hence, tracking the accelerated particles around magnetic islands suggests that the parallel acceleration does not apparently impact the energy gain of particles, but the perpendicular acceleration does.
On the other, the impact of the guide field on the motion pattern of both protons and electrons is not apparent, unless those particles could be accelerated to fairly high energy.
This research helps us to better understand the charged particles acceleration in turbulent magnetic reconnecting current sheet.

"We just spent the last two hours going all around Dodger Stadium with an FSN Prime Ticket crew and Andre Ethier, who is going to host a special show/feature about Dodger Stadium. It’s still very early in the production stages and there’s no air date set, but Andre went to all the places that the public doesn’t get to see and shows them off with pride: the clubhouse, the players’ lounge, video room, training room, batting cages, press box, Dodger offices, luxury suites, etc. Stay tuned for more info on that front.
Also, in regards to Alyssa’s blog, it’s still updated regularly and can be found here. And no, we didn’t take it down because of her open letter to Grady Little. She’s certainly welcome to her opinion and she is clearly a big Dodger fan who is as frustrated as we all are. However, her blog is not a Dodger-affiliated blog and was put up my MLB.com on the Dodger homepage to help generate interest in it. Once we started a Spanish-language blog with thoughts from Jaime Jarrin, Pepe Yniguez and Fernando Valenzuela, we figured that it made much more sense to give easy access to that blog than one that isn’t run by the team. Our hope is that there will soon be as many people posting to the Spanish one as the one we’ve got here in English.
And for those Spanish-speakers, don’t forget that Viva los Dodgers is this Saturday.
As for the post about technology on this site: I know that MLB.com is currently working on improving the technology for all of the blog sites and your suggestion is one of the many that they’re looking into. A lot of you guys gave great ideas over the winter, too, that I passed along, but obviously they have a lot of things on their plate over there and I’ll make sure they are aware of this request.
There was also one comment about whether Juan Pierre has a clause in his contract that doesn’t allow him to sit on the bench and while I’m sure it was tongue-in-cheek, I hope people realize that in this three-week slump, you can hardly blame Juan Pierre. The guy is batting .377 in August with a .421 on-base percentage and stealing bases left and right without really getting caught and playing very good center field.
It just so happens that when everyone else went into a slump, Juan has played incredibly well. If it were a player who fans were more excited about, many people would probably talk about how that guy is trying to carry the team through a slump and instead, Juan continues to be questioned. He’s the first to admit that he hasn’t had the type of season he’s capable of or that we expected when he was signed, but try to remember that if the rest of the team was playing well this month, we’d be better off and if he had played well when they weren’t slumping, we might still be in first place. The bottom line is, the Dodgers win as a team and they lose as a team, not from one guy in the lineup.
Grady did a great job with the lineup!
I cannot say that I have said that very often this season!
Let’s go crazy and win two in a row!
Same lineup as last night except with Ethier instead of Gonzo, I think we’ll score some runs against Wandy Rodriguez who is terrible away from Minute Maid Park.
With all do respect, JP isn’t doing anything much different than his career stats suggest which is misleading because of his exciting SB’s. He’s been making nice catches in CF, but the arm isn’t going to change. If his OBP was consistently around .370 then maybe his arm could be overlooked, but at .324? Everyone has hot streaks so yeah for JP.
If Grady put this lineup out there every night, I like our chances every night. Once LaRoche is healthy, look out!
It is a shame that management does not understand that not only from a performance standpoint, but also a fan’s stanpoint, Gonzo should not play on a regular basis.
This is no fault of Gonzo’s, but he just is too old! He is below average in every skill at this point in his career, he should be a PH!
Alex are you gonna be at the game tonight?
I think somebody here is a liason for Grady, isn’t this what we have been asking for in regards to the line up. Someone fess up, is it you van 19?!!!!!
Do not have tickets for tonight’s game…I do have tickets for tomorrow nights game. I’ll be blogging as usual during gametime tonight.
A good 1/2 month does not a good player make. Pierre consistenly OPS’d in the mid 600s since April – what he’s doing right now is a fluke.
I’ve had my difficulties getting fully behind JP but his attitude and type of guy he is makes it extremely difficult for me to dislike him. I know what he can do when he gets on base. I also know what impact a positive attitude can have in the club house. I support him. It’s just tough some times. And Josh, you’re absolutely right. If he were a more popular player I’m sure fans wouldn’t give him as much grief.
 I do, however, (like most of us I’m sure) wish LaRoche could get and stay healthy!
How about Ethier or Kemp run over to where Pierre is at when he fields a ball and he can pass the ball to one of them like an ultra short cutoff man?
its a good point that people kind of are ignoring pierre’s hot streak while if it were another player that most people loved we would be obssessing over it. can’t really help that though, you like who you like. id like to see everyone get as hot as he has been for sure. but then again, this is a streak and he will come back to his career norms, which many have already noted, are not good.
Wait a second Scott weren’t you the one yesterday who said you thought Pierre was gonna throw someone out at third and at the plate in last night’s game?
Haven’t had reason to bash Pierre for a while, and in fact gave him some praise just yesterday, but Josh didn’t really answer the question of whether it’s in his contract not to sit out any games. I can’t really believe that even this management would entertain that kind of a clause in a player’s contract, so I’ll just assume that it is Grady’s intention to keep Pierre’s playing streak alive unless something very extraordinary were to happen.
The reason why people aren’t feeaking out over JP’s hot streak is that a hot streak for him is a bunch of singles whereas a hot streak for anyone else might mean doubles, triples and home runs.
I know scott… and thats a good point about Pierre. I get the felling some of you guys were starting to root against him.
Oh, nice lineup just missing Laroche!
with all those stats about JP, why is he not batting lead off?
He had an RBI, a run, and 2 SB (which, effectively, turned his singles doubles). How is that not exciting?
Over the last 10 days JP has just that one RBI as well as two 0-4 games and one 1-5 game.
van, let’s just score 6 and leave a few in the bats for the Rockies, whom i believe, we will sweep.
I think that in spite of Kent’s relationship with the media and at times with his teammates, he has been a pretty good member of the Dodgers. He is a gamer who plays hurt and gives it all he’s got. He plays 2nd base pretty well for a 39 year old, he was never considered a great glove, but he holds his own. If you look at his career, he’s one of the best ever at the position and probably a first ballot HOF’er. So let’s win it for Kent also.
2. That Pierre is a minor problem in what is wrong with the team. Ned said, and I agree he is a complimentry piece ,not the main cog.
3. I always bring this up as sorta the jusifing statement. I have never had a problem with the Pierre contract other than it being too long and even thats not a big, big deal. I don’t have a problem with him on our dodgers by any means, but have a problem with him on THIS dodger team based on the pieces of the entire puzzle.
4, And yeah with the way he is running (and hitting) put him in leadoff to utlize the steal more.
Kiper..who do u put in kent’s class at 2b? Mine is a short list. I can only base it on who I have seen play.
I agree Kent is a hall of famer. If I was building a team from scratch, i’d probably take Alomar and Sandberg, and that because of defense.
somebody had asked about young being put in the IR or something…but he is in todays lineup.
Kiper Kent doen’t play a pretty good defensive 2B. He has committed a lot of errors this year even for him, and thats not even mentioning the fact that he has less range then any other second basemen in baseball. If it wasn’t for Furcal’s great range our infield defense would be the worst in baseball. Kent is a hall of famer because of his bat NOT his glove.
Blame the move to Cleveland if you want Pierre has been a much better player since the break, it’s not even close. Lofton had a great first half, but he’s back down to earth.
hahaha thats really funny van.
sorry cant say i am. just a joke between friends.
Roberto Alomar was on his way to being the best 2b by a landslide and then just fell off the face of the earth. He just lost it.
Kent is a gamer. No one can question his effort. He’s probably a little hurt still.
Ok, JP: Keep it going as long as you can dude.
swood, he’s 39 and i said, he was never considered a great glove.. OK??
was kents defense ever good? i don’t know because i didn’t follow him in his mets/giants/astros days.
Alex I think Lofton will ajust to being back in Cleveland and his numbers will slowly start to pick up.
no jspelk he has never had any range. thats one of the reasons the blue jays, his first major league team got rid of him.
i know he played some third for the bluejays/mets. can’t imagine what that was like.
I hope so! *******!!!
Kemp wil go deep tonight, maybe Martin again.
Good call Scott. I think Kemp will get really hot hitting in front of Kent.
Kent has always had a good glove. He has always been great at turning double plays. He has also always had limited range.
Now his range is like 3 feet.
I wonder if Roids happened to Alomar. Some of you guys might be younger and don’t recall Sandberg. (not the lazy sunday guy on SNL) but that Sandberg guy was sick. He won 9 straight Gold Gloves between 83-91. He won the silver slugger award 7 straight times (Kent, 4 times). He hit 40 bombs in 1990! 40!
D’Backs lead 1-0 and they have the bases loaded with nobody out in the top of the first in south florida.
Make that lead 2-0 sac fly stephen drew. first and third with one out.
Like do u guys think Biggio should be in the hall?
Can’t stand the guy, but he is the gold standard. I had no idea Morgan won back to back NL MVP awards.
Can anyone tell me what’s going on with Young? I haven’t seen his name in the Las Vegas lineup since he was since down.
rekrell I think young went 4-4 in his first game back so they sent him to AA Jacksonville. haha just kidding.
Young was on the inactive list, but he’s now active and playing for Vegas as we speak.
Mike Jacobs 2 run bomb Marlins lead 3-2.
Ok if we go on a long winning streak will you guys say its because of Grady or in spite of him???
This is the first in what I plan as a series of installments on players who some may never have heard of and others may remember fondly.
Today’s oldtimer is Jim Brewer who was the Dodgers #1 reliever from 1968 to 1973 when he was displace by Mike Marshall. Brewer is 75th on the all-time saves list, but who was in the Top Ten at one time. He threw the screwball which he learned from Warren Spahn. Brewer died in an automobile accident one day before his 50th birthday in 1987.
Great job Pierre. Now maybe we can trade him in the off-season for a center-fielder who can get on base more and can also throw. This team is badly mismanaged. When you have money for Tomko Saenz Pierre etc. they should have the money to sign a young draft pick. Other teams do.
One of the best things about Jim Brewer was that he always won the cow milking contests.
Jim Brewer was one of ten or so players to play for both the Dodgers and the Angels in the same season. Unlike Shea Hillenbrand, he was actually traded from one to the other, for Dave Sells.
fliegel: Even the Washington Nationals!
I disagree fliegel I think we should spend our money at the major league level. There’s only about a 1 in 5 chance that a 5th round draft pick will even make it to the majors so I don’t think we should throw our money around there.
It is what it is, Blair is going to college and cannot be drafted until 2010 at the earliest.
It looks like a lineup that most of us will agree on. It seems like many are looking for a particular batting order, such as all homegrown or some have favorite players. I root for the name on the front of the uniform. No matters who’s in the lineup I just want to win. The most important thing especially on this team is whose pitching. LOWE gets the ball tonight sore hip and all. LET’S CONTINUE WHERE WE LEFT OFF LAST NIGHT.
where did you come up with 1 in 5? the odds are greater than that actually. but its not the point, if you draft someone, and you believe in their talent, which they said they believe in blair’s, and you have the money to spend, you spend it.
Even if we disagree with the lineups, once the game starts will all root for the name on the front of the jersey.
Wouldnt it be funny to bat Pierre clean up just for the heck of it? The servers for Dodgers.com (MLB.com) would go down….some of you guys would be suicidal.
Blair would have been a 2nd rounder if teams thought he was signable. If we weren’t willing to go above slot to pay for him, why was he drafted in the 1st place? There is still a lot of quality talent on the board in the 5th round.
I just got 1 in 5 because I know that only 1 in 3 first rounders make the majors. I just don’t think we should be spending big bucks on a kid who will likely never help us at the major league level.
Because charris I would rather have that money go to proven veterans rather then some 17 year old immature high school kid.
yes draft choices are like stocks or poker chips. The more you have, the more you can make in the end. Not being able to sign some of our recent draft picks is dumb, not because of the individual player or the money, but it’s just wasting a draft pick. Just pick guys you can sign.
Exactly charris, you nailed what i was trying to say.  And since other teams around the mlb are doing the same thing with other picks (going overslot number), we should be too. otherwise you’re just screwing yourself. After all, we gave LaRoche a million after he was left in like the 37th or so round because everyone though he was going to college. That wasn’t even the issue with Blair, he wanted to go pro.
id rather let logan white go on spending spree than colletti.
isis hindsight is 20/20. If you don’t think you can sign a player for a reasonable price don’t sign him at all.
amen isis, thats why I’m frustrated with the situation. We could have drafted and signed a talented and much more affordable pick in his place, so if we weren’t willing to shell out the dough, why did we draft him?
swood…but all your favorite dodgers right now were all 17 year old immature high school kids. Martin, Loney, Kemp, Broxton, Billingsley.
When it’s time to spend money on the MLB roster and when those guys are available on the open market, they will cost millions.
it’s not mutually exclusive.
No one says you can’t spend money on the farm/future and not spend money on the present.
No they’re in there mid 20’s trust me there is a difference.
they are now. not when they were drafted.
actually martin was drafted out of college 🙂 but the rest of them yeah. its actually pretty amazing what white has done considering his successes have been with almost all high school kids which are a bigger gamble than college players. if its such a dumb idea to go overslot for an 18 year old, why are so many other teams doing it. did you know other teams are giving major league contracts to teenagers now b/c its what their agents demand?
All i’m saying is that Blair is a 5th rounder who everyone knew wasn’t gonna take less then 1st round money and if you weren’t going to pay him 1st round money(which I don’t think you should) why draft him in the first place?
When they were drafted i’m sure they were considered willing to take the norm amount of money for their position/ draft round.
I think the decision on Blair should have been left to Logan White. If he thought the guy’s talent was comparable to those drafted in round two, and he only slipped down to the fifth round because of signability (which turned out to be the case), Logan should have had the discretion to give him a round two signing bonus. Like jspelk said, I too would rather trust that money being spent to Logan than to Colletti.
Martin was college? my bad.
jspelk there’s nothing wrong with drafting a high school kid if you are positive you can sign him for a reasonable amount.
Do we get compensated for losing our 5th round pick in next year’s draft?
Within hours after David Wells cleared waivers and became a free agent Thursday, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies were the first teams to express interest in possibly signing the veteran left-hander.
Wells, 44, was cut free by the Padres last week, after going 5-8 with a 5.54 ERA. Gregg Clifton, his agent, has made it clear that Wells — who has 235 regular season victories, and a superlative post-season record — would like to pitch for a contender. The Dodgers have been looking for pitching, in the aftermath of a series of injuries to their starting pitchers, including Jason Schmidt and Randy Wolf. The Rockies have recently lost starters Rodrigo Lopez, Jason Hirsh and Aaron Cook to the disabled list.
isis let me rephrase that. I don’t want us to have to overpay many 5th rounders wanting 1st round money and therefore be unable to sign veterans.
an extra 400K isn’t going to stop us from signing anyone. although the schmidt/pierre contracts might.
jspelk if we’re doing that for every pick year after year it is. I’m looking at the big picture here.
Lowe going to be healthy enough to get his sinker back tonight and get a ton of ground balls?
Just out of curiosity… do you guys think Grady is to blame for this current slide?
I’m glad we didn’t get Ortiz, he’s not very good.
Grady seems like he’s trying to find a right combination in the batting order. No timely hitting, no patience at the plate and guys trying too hard to hit 3 run homeruns with no one on base(Quoting Kennedy). Their not doing anything right. I would like to see guys trying to move runners over or something. You have to be agressive and at least try to manufacture some runs.
Grady, the front office and the players are all to blame, not just one individual.
Some people on this blog have suggested that Grady alone is to blame and that he needs to be fired. I couldn’t disagree more.
Managers get too little credit for winning and too much when they are losing. Its all on the players. We’ve had some decent pitching, and our hitters need to step up.
ok mike and scurtis if people like diehard start posting that its all Gradys fault and the only reason the Angels and Tigers are good is because of their manager and the players have nothing to do with it im gonna need you guys to back me up in saying its the players fault too that we’re on this losing skid and that the Leyland and Scoiccia help but they’re not the only reason those teams are successful.
Just to comment on Grady Little’s involvement in our losing ways the past few weeks…I would just like to add that it IS the manager’s responsibility to put their team/players in the best position to win.
I cannot agree with Grady Little’s managerial moves such as letting pitchers hit in games we are losing by 4-5 runs when we have had trouble scoring runs and we have men in scoring position with 2 outs. Letting Lowe hit and leaving pitchers in too long are mistakes.
Batting Furcal (and his diminished speed) atop the line-up is also a mistake as he is IN FRONT of JP. I hate JP but still he is our best leadoff option these days.
Batting Ethier, Loney, Kemp, etc at the bottom of the line-up when Gonzo, Kent, and Nomar are struggling in spots 4-6 is a mistake. Let these players have a chance to drive in some runs since they are some of our better players at the moment. Delwyn Young on the bench after a 4-4 game.
Grady Little is far from the worst manager but he does make many mistakes. But our biggest coaching blunder has been keeping Rich Donnelly as the 3B coach. He is just not very good at his job.
And as for Colletti, i have no sympathy for him and hope he loses his job as bringing in Proctor rather than “trying” Meloan first and losing a 25yr old Switch hitting 3B in Wilson Betemit with legitimate power for a 30 yr old middle reliever abused by Torre for the past few years is atrocious. His trades are horrid. The END!
Everybody knows that you win or lose depending on well the manager manages & how well the players produce….
The most important responsibility for the manager is to put the best players on the field & make a lineup with the hitters in an order where they can be the most productive….
Unfortunatley Grady Gump has refused to do his this all year long… Quite possibly because he just isn’t capable of knowing what the right moves are…. But, also because of his blind faith in old veterans & his fear of failure by younger players….
Players win games. Managers lose games and umpires ruin games.
David Wells is drawing interest from the Dodgers and Rockies after clearing waivers and becoming a free agent Thursday.
Both teams should be willing to put him right in the rotation, and since that’s the case, we imagine Wells would prefer staying close to San Diego and joining the Dodgers.
i think the roster construction (and the players production) are the biggest reasons for the slide, but… we had one horrific slide this year and we had one last year. I do not believe Grady is blameless.
Would signing Wells be a good or a bad thing…..
 I hate to say this, but I would stick with Tomko over Wells and try Stults and/or Houlton before Wells.
Colorado is even more desperate than LA – Elmer Dessens is now in their rotation as well!
More ******* action than a Dyson.
Nice to see Ethier & Kemp in the lineup, hopefully we can give Lowe a W today.
Arizona will lose 2 out of 3 or get swept in Atlanta! We need to take advantage of this weekend against a good Colorado team.
I hope Biggio doesn’t say Goodbye again, remember on 7/24 he got a single and hit a Grand Slam, well that’s goodbye enough already.
old fogey showing knowledge of high-end vacuum cleaners.
Nice low pitch count start for D Lowe. Hoping for another win to split the series.
Speed never slumps!
That a boy Kemp and Pierre. Nice solid swing Matt.
Raffy and Pierre need to swap positions in the lineup, we can use Raffy to sac pierre over. Then Kemp gets the hits, all works out and we get runs in the first.
Well, it all turned out nicely for Kemp, but he’s probably going to get an earful in the clubhouse.
Uh-oh….UH-OH! UH-OH! WE HAVE AWOKEN!
Boy, I sure do like how Kemp just ran right through Donnelly’s “stop sign” . . up 2 in the first inning!! GO DODGERS!!!
Good start! Nice to see Kent contribute again.
At least Rodriguez doesnt look like a Cy Young like we’ve made so many other horrible pitchers look. Things are looking very good!!
Donnelly can’t stop Kemp! I think he forgot who was running those bases…not every player can’t score from first base on a double.
First inning DREAM. KENT is super, Pierre is Wills. Kemp hits too.
When was the last time Lowe was pitching in a game when we had a lead?
And if Kemp hadn’t run through the stop sign we would have stranded him. So, it definitely was worth the risk.
Anyone see that Kent piece last night with Charley Steiner after the game? If so how was it?
The amazing Superman Jeff Kent does it again!Ain’t no mountain high enough!Way to go Grady Little,keeping Furcal and Pierre, 1 & 2 in the batting line up.Watch out everybody,here come The Dodgers!
You are not going to believe this one…or maybe you will. The last time Derek Lowe pitched with a lead of ANY KIND…June 22nd against the Devil Rays.
The last time against a team from the National League June 4th against the Pirates.
Last time Lowe pitched with a lead, July 22nd in a 7th inning relief appearance against the Mets in LA. Last time he did it when he started, @SF on July 14th, which we blew a 6-2 lead on a Winn grand slam.
maybe Derek can hit it to Left field this time, much harder to be thrown out….
Well at least he didnt have to run.
Yeah, July 14th, I blocked that grand slam from memory. In a game he won June 22nd, overall July 14th, thanks fezzik.
lol forget his last win, its gotta be a relief for him to get the run support, but that Gnats game has got to be in the back of his mind. Hopefully Biggio isnt the hero tonight.
Lowe looks impressive with only 31 pitches so far through 3.
keeps this up a CG is within reach and gives the ‘pen a night off.
Agreed. The pen could use a break.
A very nice AB by KEMP.
/agreed Pierre… the sooner we knock out the starter, who is getting off lucky with a couple plays. Just work the count and he will be out soon.
That is one crusty, old, and filthy helmet on B-G-O!
Martin has that throw down to second down to a science, always love watching him throw the balls down there.
Beautiful Strike em out, throw em out. Lowe at 42 pitches through 4.
Kent has got his stroke back.
I hope Kent didn’t aggravate his hamstring on that double.
we’ll take them however we can get em.
It’s good to see J.K. out of his slump.
Kent is out of his, Martin looks to be coming out of his. Loney is still looking a bit off. Dont be surprised if Martin and Loney swap batting positions tomorrow night.
Kent looks to be struggling on his feet, not again.
NIICE! Another twin killing. Lowe’s go good stuff tonight.
52 pitches through 5 for lowe. Even he is coming out of his pitching slump. Looks like Lowe is returning as the viable #2 pitcher in the rotation.
Lamb for President!!!
KEMP is patient and is swinging that bat well tonight.
Sorry folks CF & 2B are taken at the moment.
The superstitious hung garlic over themselves to ward off evil spirits.
Looks like Gordon Biersch is going to have a shortage for their Garlic Fries. 
I love the line up! who said a line up doesn’t matter they sure are more fun to watch.
Oh well. One run beats none.
For those who are unable to watch the game, or hear Vinny mention it, There are garlic cloves under the Dodger bench. sure glad I didnt drop $125 for the seats behind the dugout.
This is the best Lowe has looked in a while!
64 pitches through 6…. very nice!!!
maybe he can finally get a complete game win this year.
sssshhhhh! Lowe is doing ok.
Is ethier trying too hard?
little finally got it right 8/16 please don’t mess with the line up.
When there is something to play for? Havent we been playing for something all year?? Everyone is talking about how well he is playing tonight as opposed to how he has pitched recently due to the hip.
I hope Randolph is okay, scary thing is that it is probably a ligament injury.
hate to see a guy get hurt lik that. Lowe put down a nice bunt to set up raffy.I predict he clutches up to break open the game.
isn’t raffy up?
Good call Diehard.
Way to go Berkman! We’ll take it.
Is it just me or is Berkman a little cry baby… I’ve seen him complaining a lot this series.
Furcal should get two ribbies they were scoring anyway.
FURCAL 2nd hit. LOWE is for change is getting some runs while he is pitching good.
I love Biggio, always have had the most respect for him. Gonna be hard to imagine the Astros without him. THANK YOU CRAIG!!
I know Alex I was just watching that game… bummer.
Nice Play Raffy!!!!
Furcal has sooooooo much range defensively. He kind of evens up our middle infield with Kent at 2B.
Gotta love it! Season high 4 DP’s for the boys in blue.
I think I mentioned this afternoon to give Kent a chance when everyone was down on him. Who is the hero now??
manfromchina are you posting that from china?
I think I was defending raffy this afternoon as well.
85 pitches… that **** 1 pitch at bat was an entire inning for him.
Pete LaForest the Padres third string catcher is having a huge night tonight. San Diego up 11-6… bummer.
This is a Derek Lowe game!
well then why is your email address manfromchina? haha?
Cant wait to get the Rox this weekend. Gonna be fun to watch us play them with the healthy bats.
FURCAL has made many outstanding plays, but you got to admit that B__I__G L_E_G S_T_R_R_E_T_C_H was a little odd.
Kent’s doubles machine tonight!
Is Stults still the most likely canidate to start tomorrow night’s game?
Kemp needs to sit out for the rest of the night. His knee gave on him before he hit the bag. May not see him play again for a couple days.
ball boy needs to make a play!
Rox on the comeback trail Tulowitzki RBI single. 11-7. first and second one out.
Make that 11-8 Holliday RBI single.
We need KENT.
Sure doesn’t look like a pitchers duel at petco tonight does it?
Oh yeah. I remember this team now. Nice. I am willing to limp into the playoffs. As bad as we have looked, no one in the NL is any better really. Come on Blue, let’s put 5 or 6 wins in a row at least. 
I think Lowe could have gone another inning.
Maybe this was Little being smart and pulling someone early, before things got out of hand. I always have criticized him about not pulling pitchers in time.
He could have left lowe in longer but Grady didn’t want to hear diehard complain about how he always leaves pitchers in too long. haha just kidding diehard.
11-8 in San Diego, Im guess Chris Young is a bit rusty.
11-9 now Atkins RBI single.
Chris Young didn’t start that game. Clay Hensley did.
my bad Hennsley started tonight, I thought Young did.
outfielder could have set up lawn chairs with Lowe in, now they actually need to work.
I thought Dessens was a middle reliever. Colorado must be real desperate for pitching.
GET RUDY OUT OF THERE!!!
good, we get to see jonathan in the 9th… watch the future closer in the 9th.
Doesn’t it feel good to see LOWE back in the grove. I’m only concern with his health. He looked strong though. And it was great to see him get 6 runs Yes runs for a change on a night he pitched good.
Hernadez in the ninth, exactly what I suspected. Smart and hopefully we can give both Broxton and Saito a game off that we win.
Colorado has 3 starters on the DL.
Im gonna start listening to what Alex says, good call. Hopefully this mean hernandez wont be available tomorrow night with the mystery pitcher on a pitch count.
Save situation coming up for Saito. Why did we pick him up? Might as well have asked Orel to come out of the broadcasters booth.
Meloan? Can you hear me?
There goes the shutout! Nice going Roberto!
It Blowberto TIME!!!!
Abreu? Can you hear me?
Saito’s night off just got revoked.
Thank you Grady, get Sammy in to clean this one up. DFA Roberto.
I was going to say it was a wild cleanup job by RUDY & BERT.
lol guess I got a jump start on the DFA comments.
a shutout really would have helped with momentum and everything.
Why the helll are Rudy & Roberto on our pitching staff…..

Rudy is spotty and seems to be on when Beimel is off.
Lee thought twice about running on Kemp.
man from china…momentum is as good as your next days starting pitcher.
31 out of 34 is awesome! Way to go Saito! Here’s hoping we keep it going, and beat up on the Rocks!
speaking of jon meloan. He got the win tonight for vegas. Has his ERA down to 2.57. LaRoche wasn’t in the lineup tonight.
I cant believe you guys!! We’re gonna win this game and you’re worrying about DFA’ing Roberto and Ramon? Are you forgetting about Tomko, Hendrickson and all the other worthless acquisitions Ned has made? Let’s start the list of bad pickups….
Max do you know why LaRoche didn’t play tonight? Is he still hurt?
I’m not arguing that list, but Ethier, you cannot forget Ethier in the good moves list.
Ok Max you seem to be one of the most knowledgable Dodger fans here. Who do you blame for the recent slide Grady, management or the players?
Schmidt – could still be a good move. We’ll see if he’s healthy. And you really think that two weeks later we know if Proctor for Betemit was good/bad?
Good moves: Maddux? Remember that?
Nomar, Beimel, Ethier…trading Navarro to give Martin his spot…picking up Betemit for a fairly productive year…etc.
Anyway. It’s just funny how people tend to forget what they want to forget. You could try to say the same thing about me, I suppose, but I’ve made your two lists before and they were much more comprehensive.
Two in a row!! go Dodgers! I wonder if you guys could go a couple of minutes without criticisim of the management or players. Let’s just bask in the glow of winning.
Swood…the recent slump was a combination of horrible veterans, bad lineups and bad coaching.
I dunno Max I may not be seeing straight on this one but I just don’t see it being Gradys fault the way the rest of these guys do. I mean I see Grady trying everything.
RH hitters hitting .167 againsr Hernandez with Dodgers but Little uses him against LH hitters as well.
puppy, thats why it was just a list. i want people to add to it and see how it balances out.
as for the proctor for betemit move…i would say it is a bad move for the simple reasoning that Betemit is 25yr old switch hitting position player with a potent bat that can play 2B, SS, 3B and maybe OF while Proctor is a middle reliever who has no more potential than he has already showed and is also 30yrs old.
in my mind, that’s a bad trade. for the long run thats a bad trade. for winning now, thats a bad trade. we had meloan tearing up AA and AAA all year. we had options..
i thought i was doing well forgetting Lugo and the JD Drew debacle. But absolutely yes….Ethier, Maddux were great moves. I don’t know if the Dioner trade was what I would consider a good move. Yes it opened up catcher for Martin but Dioner had options remaining and we packaged him with Chuck tiffany and Justin Ruggiano for Hendrickson. so Im not sure how much i love that deal in all honesty.
Ethier and Maddux were fabulous deals though.
for so-so deals i would put Wolf, Lieberthal, and Tsao on the list for this year.
I never thought I’d hear myself say this, but I’m hoping the Braves beat up on the Dbacks while the Dodgers beat up the Rocks. Gotta admit, one of the best things to ever happen to the Dodgers was the switch to the 3 division setup that put the Braves in the east.
Yay. A win.
Problem is it should have been a SHUTOUT.
THROW STRIKES. Make your opponent earn their way on base, don’t issue free passes. The two walks came in to score. If they didn’t happen, the final is 6-0.
What’s it going to take for the Dodgers to throw a shutout? 5 all season? This staff is better than THAT.
Pardon me for not really celebrating something that was SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
Edwin Jackson and Chuck Tiffany for Danys Baez and Lance Carter.
Dioner Navarro and Jae Seo for Toby Hall, Mark Hendrickson, and cash.
Edwin Jackson, Chuck Tiffany and Willy Aybar for Scott Proctor and one season of Wilson Betemit.
Tsao cost nothing but his minimum salary. The fact we got anything out of him (24 2/3 IP, 18 H, 16/8 K/BB, 1.054 WHIP) makes it a plus acquisition. Can’t ever have too much pitching.
Oh, Ruggiano was the PTBNL in the Hendrickson deal. Forgot about that.
thanks fogey, yeah i tend to mix up those d-rays trades since they were all in a short time period of each other. add in the lugo deal and it’s blake johnson, joel guzman, justin ruggiano, edwin jackson, chuck tiffany, willy aybar for scott proctor.
sorry, i forgot one. it’s scott proctor AND mark hendrickson. yippee!
Not resigning MAddux should go in the VERY BAD moves pile.
I always felt not offering arbitration to Maddux was the mistake. Re-signing is a totally different situation. He accepts and you get Greg Maddux for one more year. He leaves you get compensation and as it turned out it would’ve been from San Diego. Lowe, Penny, Schmidt, Maddux, Billingsley. That was my dream rotation for 07 after last season. It’s not as if Maddux is lighting the world on fire this season, but I really enjoyed watching him play the game in Chavez Ravine in the blue.
Fantastic victory by our Los Angeles Dodgers! Superman Jeff Kent is a true Los Angeles Dodger and a truly great,great leader!Derek Lowe,way to go! You really are a champion pitcher!Way to go team!Ain’t no mountain high enough!
Maddux brought so much more to the team then what he did ever 5 days. Plus he never gets hurt and he’s good for 10-15 wins every year.
Instead of giving Maddux a 2 year 20 million dollar deal we gave schmidt a 3 year 47 million dollar deal and wolf a one year 8 million dollar deal and they both are hurt right now.
Now we have to see what the back end of our rotation can do with the power hitting Rockies..and then we face Phillies and Mets…should know alot by end of next week.
I just hope that the 2 -3 week fall we took didn’t doom our season…Stay tuned.
have a good sleep huh?
is it good to see the dodgers win 2 straight?
Nice all around game last night. A friend just gave me 2 tickets for tonight! Grady better not start Olmedo at 1b!
Now we just need those darn D-backs to start losing.
Now we just need those blasted D-backs to start losing.
i can smell a Kemp rest, though!
Oh NO…just saw Dodgers and Rockies interested in David Wells…just what we need…another used up pitcher…He’s been terrible this year…Say it ain’t so.!
I would totally roll with David Wells. He is no worse than Mark Henderickson. He also may be super bitter at the Padres and that could help. He typically throws strikes and has a great playoff pitching record. He is worth a flyer based on what we have have in house now.
isis, Hendrickson is no longer in the rotation, and actually, he was better than Tomko, who somehow is still in the rotation. I am not a big David Wells fan, but do what the DBacks did with Kim, 1 or 2 starts if it doesn’t work, drop him. Hey, if not Wells it’s gonna be Tomko, so it’s worth a shot.
I am not a Wells fan either but I think you guys are right. If Tomko, Hendu and Wells all had an era of 6.00 and I had to ask one of the three to start a playoff game, i’d go with Wells. Of course maybe we don’t make the playoffs…I think he is a better option than contreras who is still owed 20 million bucks.
Did you guys see that Zambrano just resigned with the cubs 5yrs 90 million.
why is Ned so scared about this rookies… those guys are our future… they need to have a taste in the Bigs!
van, I agree with that, Stults will go tonight. But if Colletti is hesitant to make any more moves with the young guys, pitchers, i would not mind giving Wells a look see….
“How can we? We lose all our money from Texas,” Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Thursday.
The GM said the team’s position has been reported before, so it shouldn’t be surprising.
That’s just talk from Cashman. I fully believe they would be competing for a-rod if he ops out.
I’m ok with giving him a look see start since he’s not carrying a huge multi year salary like Contreras.
Tomko has a good arm, but he turns mental too quick out there and loses focus. Stick with your charcoal paintings Brett.
I agree Scott. Plus if they don’t resign him, Boston will. I would say the SF Giants have a much better shot at signing him than we would.
The ARod sweepstakes will come down to the Yankees, White Sox, Angels, Giants and Dodgers. The Cubs are on the market and will have their hands tied and the Red Sox will not go after ARod.
The Dodgers have as good a chance as anybody, but i would imagine ARod’s first choice would be the Yankees..
I just don’t see why anyone would want to play for the Giants who have won 0 WS in SF and last won as NY in 1954 and had to cheat their way in in 1951 with the CF telescope tipping off pitches.
Remember ARod played for Pinella in Seattle and they are still friends. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him go to the north side of chicago.
Can the Cubs afford another huge contract on top of 90 Million they gave Zambrano?
Did the cubs resign Zambrano today? I’ve been busy and I haven’t got a chance to see what’s been going on.
If we sign ARod what will we do with Furcal? I’m sure ARod will want to sign somewhere where he can play shortstop.
18.3 per year, slightly more than Zito per year.
Makes me laugh when you think about the Giant Debacle with that deal.
do u want furcal or A-Rod?
I read an article in the NY Post about a month ago, in the article ARod says that at this stage in his career he would more than likely remain at 3rd base. He would not rule out a return to SS, but he says he would like to remain at third.
The giants have made some real bad signings recently. Van, I want ARod but Im just asking what would happen to Furcal? Would he try to play third? Would we try to trade him?
O kiper I didn’t know that.
The Dodgers do not have anyone that would be in the way of A-Rod on the field. SS or 3B would be trade bait.
The safest senario would be A-rod at 3b since laroche is less proven than Raffy, but you never know.
swood, ARod would play third.
Arod to the Dodgers would be HUGE! How much money will McCourt make if he does that. I guarentee every game will sell out before the season. How many of us would go buy an Arod jersey the next day I would! the gnats stink they have no one in the minors we have more money than the gnats they are an old team Arod wants to win a championship add him to the puzzle in the NL we are favorites.
If Kent can play 2b I don’t see why LaRoche couldn’t.
Furcal is good defensive SS with a great arm. I really like him there and he’s not that old yet. I like Hu over Abreu as well.
people please don’t be down on my boy Furcal he will clutch up. He carried us last year, he’s going to get hot!
Furcal is a much better player than he has shown this year. It’s hard to tell who’s to blame for him not going on the DL, management or Furcal, but it’s clear that he started the season hurt and never got healthy. We will see a different Raffy next season, this season he may get hot for a while but he’s not the bat he was or can be.
There was some talk about Furcal switching to OF when he was a FA searching for a new team. Probably unlikely though.
I know many of you are gonna bash me for this but I don’t really want A-Rod. He’ll eat-up such a huge portion of our payroll and we probably wouldn’t be able to sign all of these kids once they close in on free-agency. Cashman is on record as saying he wouldn’t want to eat that entire salary and we’re talking the HUGE Yankees payroll. I dunno, I have mixed feelings A-Rod would be exciting here in LA but it might cost us in the long-run, we might end up as Texas part II (a superstar on a bad team).
Valid concerns charris. So far A-Rod has not helped anyone win anything with al of his massive stats, but he also hasn’t been on teams with a decent pitching staff.
I say it’s 50-50 and the Dodgers are in pretty good shape with or without him.
charris, this is not a bashing, but ARod signing will not really affect the young Dodgers pending free agency. First of all, none of them are eligible for free agency for at least 3 years. By then ARod would be 2 years into his contract and would have generated plenty of revenues to help sign some of those players. Now, to compare the Dodgers to the Rangers, that doesn’t even merit an answer.
I guess the question would have to be will McCourt invest a lot more in the team if he gains in revenue? In 3 years what if Loney becomes a .320-20-100 guy and Kemp becomes a .300-40-120 guy? They will be asking for major jack to resign with us. Not to mention Martin and Billingsley who will no doubt demand big contracts too. I don’t see a huge ceiling for Ethier but I think he’ll demand some pretty big $$$ too. At that time all of these guys will be approaching their prime playing years as A-Rod will be leaving his.
I don’t see A-rod happenning for two reasons.
2. McCash won’t pony up.
Well then the question, charris, is.. Do you want to win now or later? It sounds like your comfortable with being mediocre for a few more years until Loney hits his 20+ HR’s and Kemp hits his 40+ HR’s. In the meantime ARod will hit his 40+ every year and when our guys hit their “prime” and ARod drops from his, in what 4 to 5 years? He’ll be 36 or 37, he’ll definitely drop off to 35 HR’s. I can see your point.
boy i can’t w8 for Kemp to have that kind of season..
This whole thing is not about ARod, it’s about the Dodgers needing somebody with power in the line up next season. Obviously ARod would be the preferred flavor, but they need to be involved in conversations with somebody who carries a big stick. I believe that regardless of whether or not the young guys, namely Loney, Kemp and Ethier, play every day, they are not 30+ HR guys….yet!!
It just seems to me that our organization is building for the future whether we like it or not (they made that clear at this season’s trade deadline). So if we’re rolling the dice with all of these kids, we should at least put ourselves in a position to resign them after they’ve gotten past their growing pains in the big leagues.
I agree with that kiper, I just think that their are better options out there for our future than A-Rod. I honestly think we should trade Ethier (while his value might be slightly inflated due to his undetermined ceiling) and get a good young pitcher, then go out a sign Torii Hunter so we can strengthen our rotation, defense (Pierre would be in left) and offense (Hunter is currently a better hitter than Ethier). Sure he isn’t a monster stick, but he’s good and kemp/Loney will probably put up better #s next year as well.
charris, that’s a good point. And like i said, it’s not about ARod, it’s about getting somebody who can push a few runs across and make the team a little better. We’re not that far away.
I don’t want Hunter and Pierre in the same lineup. He’s another low OBP guy who is slugging more than usuall this season. Buyer BEWARE!
scott, his defense and occasional pop make him more valuable than most, low OBP is fine if good run production is there.
A-rod is not the answer, I agree with Charris. The answer is to get creative and trade for a young masher who might be a little closer than our current young players in being the next A-rod type player.
Miguel Cabrerra comes to mind.
I also like Alexi Rios he seems to have a bright future.
I would look at Aaron Rowand heavily as a FAs and move Pierre to left if you cant move him off the roster.
Good call isis, Rowand may not be a bad option next year and he will certainly be more affordable than Jones and probably Hunter.
Wells would be a good signing because of this fact (which, I am about 90% certain of). If a player gets released in the middle of his contract, and gets picked up after that, the releasing team is still on the hook for hir guaranteed salary, while the signing team is only on the hook for the MLB minimum. So we could have Stults (who will take over Hendy’s spot in rotation otherwise) for the minimum or David Wells. There is an argument that Wells has lost so much that Stults is better, but a roll of the dice that we might see the David Wells of old for 6 angry weeks is worth it. Right now, we’re the short stack, and we need to find a good hand to go all-in with.
I agree with charris about not signing ARod. He fills needs, and is a good player, but he never seems to win. He’s Mr. April! Maybe he will turn that around, but the bigger issue is the salary. I can agree that he should be the highest paid player in the game, but what he’s getting now–much less what he will be paid if he opts out–is just too much. His salary ruined the Rangers, because they didn’t have anything to sign anyone else. If ARod hits .350 with 60 home runs, you still need 5 starters and 8 other hitters. It’s not basketball where Jordan alone can guarantee you a spot in the Conference Finals (and even Kobe can’t do that).
 We can (and do) spend a lot, but there is a limit even for the Dodgers. Admittedly, because of the young/cheap talent, we have some flexibility, but I’d still rather see a front-line starter as the FA signing, and Nomar/LaRoche at 3B next season.
Cabrera would be ideal if we’re looking for a guy who gonna go out there and throw up huge #s, plus that makes LaRoche expendable for a good trade.
Rowand instead of Ethier? He’s having an unusually super productive year. I would rather keep Ethier than gamble that Rowand has suddenly become more than a great CF with ok offensive skill. Ethier is a better offensive player at his age than Rowand was.
I think Pierre in CF would cost us more runs than Ethier’s offense compared to Rowand but yeah I see your point. I just really don’t want Pierre in CF next year.
Kemp is OPSing .860 and slugging .503 highest on team for both.
 To call him Mr. April is unfair he had a bad post season last year but what did he do before that?
That’s pretty clutch for me. Arod had a hard time last year he put too much pressure on himself he will have a huge postseason AGAIN this year.
i can’t believe u want rowand rather than have ethier..?
are u the one who is spending money for A-Rod?
A-Rod is a complete package..
the guy haven’t won a championship… so what?
Isis & Charris: On the Cabrera issue, I think what you guys are failing to see is that the Marlins have no intent to trade the guy. And even if they do, it would take the farm to get him. I mean, look at what Texas was asking for Teixaira; and I think we all would agree Cabrera is a much better player.
The thing about A-Rod is that he’ll be there for the taking. Players like him don’t hit free agency very often. If McCourt thinks he can get him and still retain some level of financial flexibility, he should definitely go after him.
This team needs a star. And any talk about A-rod not being a winner is either driven by personal animus or pure unsubstantiated speculation. I watch the Yankees play on a regular basis and the guy shows passion day in and day out. Baseball is a team game; it is simply unfair to say A-rod’s teams have not won because of him.
With our young, cheap talent, I think we’re in the perfect spot to make a run after A-Rod. Considering his talent, durability, and all-time HR record breaking potential, I think he makes a moderately safe investment.
A lot of weird things were happening en route to a 2-13 stretch that dropped them from first place to fourth faster than you say Nomar Garciaparra. On Tuesday, Mark Sweeney, a heady player by nature and recent pickup, was embarrassingly doubled off first base on a foul popout to Astros’ catcher Brad Ausmus to end a 7-4 loss and prevent powerful Matt Kemp from coming up as the potential tying run. Sweeney apparently managed to lose track of the ball and the outs simultaneously.
All the Dodgers would like to forget the horrid two-week stretch. A shoulder injury to left-hander Randy Wolf, who they hope can return in September, and a nagging hip injury to righty Derek Lowe, didn’t help. But the main problem is a surprising lack of hitting. Hard as it is to believe, the Dodgers were on the cusp of playing their way out of baseball’s tightest division before two consecutive victories over Houston steadied them and kept them within 6 1/2 games of red-hot Arizona, the surprise first-place team.
If the Dodgers don’t make it back — and it’s still too early to count them out, now — questions will linger about whether they were overprotective of their impressive stash of top prospects at last month’s trade deadline. The scuttlebutt around the game is that involved-owner Frank McCourt — who’s been conspicuously absent in a box often occupied by only a glum Tommy Lasorda and another less-known underling or two this week — made all their many top prospects off-limits, or close to that. Word going around is there was a split within the hierarchy about how protective to be with their prospects, as well.
But Colletti, who made several daring moves last July to help the Dodgers tie for the top spot and win a playoff berth, insisted in an interview with SI.com that the organizational decisionmakers were all “on the same page” regarding their reluctance to trade their very top young players and prospects for veteran help. No one wanted to hinder their future for the present.
Word is the Rangers sought smooth young first baseman James Loney plus at least superb pitching prospect Clayton Kershaw, whom the Dodgers declared untouchable, for Mark Teixeira. L.A. preferred to include some next-tier prospects with Loney. For Teixeira and reliever Joaquin Benoit, the Rangers also wanted young outfielder Andre Ethier. The Dodgers found the prices too high for A’s pitcher Joe Blanton, White Sox pitcher Jon Garland and outfielder Jermaine Dye, as well. While Colletti wouldn’t address specific requests, he said they “weren’t about to tear apart their roster,” suggesting other teams were targeting young players already on their 25-man squad.
Some other Dodgers people believe they were handicapped by extra high demands that reflected their impressive collection of young prospects and players, who include Kemp — who some view as a Dave Winfield-type — Ethier, pitcher Chad Billlingsley, minor-league third baseman Andy LaRoche and minor-league pitcher Jon Meloan. The Dodgers’ suspicion is trade partners felt more comfortable getting another organization’s top prospect even if, in the Dodgers’ estimation, their fifth- or sixth-best prospect may have been just as good. Colletti said they never received an offer that made them even “waver,” showing how steadfast they were in their resolve to keep top young talent.
Last July, Colletti was able to grab Greg Maddux, Julio Lugo and others with deals for prospects, but so far this summer they’ve only made smaller deals, adding reliever Scott Proctor and infielder Shea Hillenbrand as well as Sweeney. Still, it’s hard to second guess them for playing it cautious with top young players such as Kemp, Ethier, Loney and Kershaw, who some view as one of the two or three best pitching prospects in the minors. “They absolutely did the right thing,” one competing GM said.
The Dodgers’ talent is also such that anyone could still see them getting back into a very quirky NL West race. And yet, if they don’t make it back, like many others, they still might be asking themselves whether their decision to protect their future cost them the present.
i wonder what ARod would cost in FA? $28-$30mill per year for what 3-4yrs so he can hit FA again when he’s 33-34 and still in his prime? or would he want it for 7-8yrs? My guess is ARod signs a 3yr deal with Ned for $32mill/yr so he can hit FA again when he’s 33 and go for the 6-7yr deal worth about the same per year.
my question is…is Arod worth more than two 16 million dollar players?
If its true that McCourt was being protective of our young talent, then I have to applaud him (although part of me wonders whether its just him thinking of saving $ in the future). Also, you have to consider how much McCourt is going to want to spend this offseason. He spent alot last offseason, and of course got minimal return. Our payroll will already be high even if not a not another cent is spent. Not only do I not see ARod coming here but I don’t see McCourt ponying up the money.
I would take the 2 $16 million players.
after you take those 2 what’s next?
is it a championship?
van, we don’t have a single player on our roster right now making $16 mill. If $16 mill get you 2 guys with 30+ HR and 100+ RBI potential thats 60 jacks 200 RBI, numbers A-Rod would not come close to touching in Chavez.
If Beltre and Green could hit 49 hrs each as Dodgers, why would far superior a-rod do less?
scott, how many 60 HR 200 RBI seasons has anyone ever had?
Sorry I forgot to post above that those are all the FA’s next year (so far) along with ages. I dont know what players on this list I would pair up and consider them as a better option than ARod.
Even if none are available does it make it neccessary to sign A-Rod. Seriously put it in perspective, we don’t have a player that will make half of what A-Rod will next year, thats CRAZY!
I’m not paying the payroll we already have one of the most expensive ticket prices. We lead the NL attendance almost every year, we are the LA DODGERS we can afford it!! what our payroll is 150 million next year so what. that still is not as much as the yankees.
I would rather go for Hunter and possibly Johan who might opt out this year. It might be a little more than A-Rod but it would improve our team so much more.
charris, u have a point….what type of descention would occur if we were to have 1 player making more than double what our next highest player makes while key contributers such as Billz, Kemp, Loney, Ethier, and our All-Star stud Catcher make at or near the minimum while contributing just as much? We also have Lowe AND Furcal heading into their contract years which could create problems trying to re-sign them if we wanted.
Johan will not be a FA until AFTER 2008. Where is Torrie Hunter going to play? We signed JP for 5 years and he is occupying CF for us for at least the next year or 2. Ned will not admit he made a mistake that quickly.
A-Rod is no doubt the best player in baseball but baseball is the ultimate team sport and he would just kill us financially.
Charris, you have to add waht you think a-rod would do plus another player currently on the team and you would exceed 60/200 easily with any of the young guys.
It’s simple trade Ethier for a quality pitcher, move Pierre to left (where his arm is no where near as exposed)and put a gold glove centerfielder out there. An outfield of Pierre, Hunter, Kemp is ridiculously fast and would save our pitchers a ton of runs over the course of a season.
That’s why I keep saying no A-Rod, yes he is the best player in baseball, but baseball requires 25 players to win, not 1 player, that’s why he has never won.
yeah scott but for A-Rod $ we could get a front-line starter and a guy that throws up good offensive #s, the kids are already here so you can’t include them in this.
lvproduction, yes A, JOnes will probably fetch that kind of money and in my mind he’s way more than 1/2 the player that A-Rod is even with his terrible year this year.
and Repko the 4th outfielder next year is really good.
we have 24 players we need 1 power bat and the most prolific power hitter in history is going to be a free agent. We aren’t the rangers or the mariners. The Dodgers are making a boat load of money adding Arod would only increase our revenua and exposure. How many Arod jerseys is McCourt going to sell in the first year alone.
A.Jones is the most overrated CF he had one good power year and hits .260 his range is going down as fast as his weight is going up.
Do any of you guys no who Martin and Loney’s agent is.
Kemp and Bills agent is Dave Stewart which I think is pretty **** cool.
If Colletti is smart you resign the younger guys before they become elgible for free agency so you eventually save money. Pay the young guys earlier to save in the long run. That is what the Indians do.
diehard is correct.
diehard, you still won’t save money…they all have agents and their agents will go fetch market value for them before they sign any extension.
not all agents are Boras. If you have a good relationship treat these kids right before you have too, I think they will remember that. Your paying them before you have too by adding more years to a contract.
A-Rod is not worthy, please guys listen to me. He has no world series rings, none.
He won’t give us enough to sign all ofour kids, they’ll all want way more than the revenue A-Rod pulls in.
Anybody know who went down for Eric Stults? I’m guessing Eric Hull.
not the best comparison. unless your trying to say that bringing in A-rod would destroy the dodgers.
Let A-Rod stay in american league.
charris you think we have lifetime contracts with all of our guys. By the time we have to resign the youngsters we wil have all these pitchers off the books. Plus we still have Logan White adding prospects in the minors.
okay van 19, let him win with the kids on the nationals then.
Nobody on our team (with the exception of Kent 11 mill. and Schmidt 12.5 mill.) is making much more than 7.5 mill a year. If our kids produce like many have projected, their extensions will be much pricier than that.
can shaq win w/o Kobe?
send him in!
That market is ridiculously low which makes Ethier even more important. No way he goes anywhere…I’m really starting to love Ethier in left with Kemp in right. There’s no reason whatsoever those two shouldn’t be in the lineup every day. Options are limited as to what we can do this offseason. Except for upgrading the pitching staff. Pitching, pitching and more pitching. I like Lopez and while risky picking up Wolf’s option may be a good move, because we do need a lefty in the rotation not named Hendrickson. If we let Wolf go, Hendrickson without a doubt would be retained if for at the very least insurance. Tomko is gone.
furcal is making 13 isn’t he?
can shaq win w/o another superstar?
what is Lowe making? what about Penny?
how many HR’s did Hunter have this year?
my bad jspelk, you’re right, but I think Furcal’s salary would even be a conservative estimate of what many of our youngsters could potentially ask for if they play up to their potential.
van, the good question is can A-Rod win without another superstar because we may not have enough dough for anymore if we sign him.
alot of people wants J.O!
Remember guys that salary figures will not remain stagnant and whatever A-Rod gets next year might seem very reasonable in 2-3 years.
Another good point being made is by time the young guys are eligable to make big bucks, other high contracts will be expiring like Furcal and Schmidt.
diehard, if they start putting up ridiculous #s next year, I doubt they’ll want to sign an extension until they are closer to becoming FA’s.
gonzo,nomar off the books also that’s a lot of money we are opening up for the kids when they are ready. Why can’t we have a payroll of 150 million that will let Arod fit into the budget nicely.
why won’t they sign let me see I make 300,000 for two more years or I get 10 million a year if I add two more years with the team I think that’s reasonable.
I will believe a $150 mill payroll here when I see it, we’re not the Yankees and while we have more $ than most, it’s not unlimited.
The dodgers sell out nightly without A-rod. The only difference would be ticket prices would go up which adds revenue, but at our exspense.
There are plenty of dodger jerseys being sold, plenty of hats being sold. Sure there will be an initial a-rod jersey buying breakout but thats it. That money goes to MLB players association, not individual teams.
As for TV revenue, nothing would change. Contracts are already signed, we might be on TV more nationally, but that wouldn’t make up for paying him. Not even close.
A-rod would not make a difference, other than on the field and that’s debatable.
Not one Mariner was sad when A-rod left, Texas players came out and said they were happy he was gone. In NY he has pretty much been hated by the fans there. I can see why. He is whiny, he is all about a-rod and he talks as if he has won, when in reality not one team that has aqquired A-rod been better since aquiring him.
He is a **** of a hitter and baseballs best player. Kobe is the NBA’s best player. Best players don’t equal winning all the time. The under .500 record over the last three laker seasons is proof of that.
For 150 million less dollars I’d be willing to take my chances on laRoche at 3b.
 The lakers make the lakers rich. The lakers will be great after Kobe leaves just like they were great before he got here. And even the strongest Kobe defender has to admit that the orginization has been in turmoil pretty much since the day he arrived due to his me first attitude.
It’s a team sport. He didn’t win the rings the lakers won rings. All of them.
are u saying that all this young guys we have are all for money?
It’s obvious charris is not a fan of ARod’s, and he’s not alone. But, if you are talking about signing him, you are looking at 5 to 6 years at about $30 million per. The young guys that you are worried about (Martin, Ethier, Kemp, Loney) will not be eligible fro free agency until their 5th year in the league. If you sign them to extensions before that you can put off free agency for another 2 years, by then a guy like ARod is in his 4th or 5th year of his contract. Now, if you really believe that any of the kids are gonna have monster years that will put them in a position to ask for lets say 12 to 15 mil per year, well then that means the Dodgers will go through at least 3 great years at a low price for all these players. I don’t know about you, but i’ll take it.
Still Kobe hater!
jerseys and hats sold don’t go to the player association that is false. Arod will double our sales. Plus carry us deep into the playoffs. Trust me McCourt is making money and will continue to make money.
van, these kids haven’t really gotten paid yet, so yeah I think its safe to assume that they’ll be fetching top dollar or close, they may give us a hometown discount but our offer still needs to be competitive.
well said Kiper!
If we don’t go after A-Rod, then fine, but I don’t want the team throwing foolish money at a fools gold player like Torii Hunter who as soon as the clock strikes midnight will turn into Mike Cameron.
Thanks diehardblu….Go Dodgers!!
kiper, good points and I am a fan of A-Rod just not his contract. If the Dodgers can find a way to sign him and keep the kids and go out and add good pitching then I’m all for it. I just don’t see that happening.
I’m afraid Nomar might be finished. He’s a good team guy though and maybe he can be convinced to be a utility/pinch hitter type for his final year or we can get someone else to believe he can still be great and trade us a young arm for him.
Ok i’ll chime in. I wouldn’t sign any player over the age of 27 to a lucrative deal.
I’m not hardly convinced, like somebody said above: we’ll be off the hook on our pitcher’s contracts in a few years, and then what? No way in my mind we can sign A-Rod, sign all of our kids to extensions, and stay competitive in the FA market for pitchers. The Yankees couldn’t even do that, look at their rotation.
is it a championship team for you?
are u grady?
These kids can’t ask for a raise until their fourth year in the majors. When they do they won’t be asking for as much money as you think they will. If they do that means we’ve seen something very special. So, lets just hope they ask for 10 million plus. They’re all locked up for 6 years anyway regardless. Martin, Bills, Broxton, Loney, Ethier and Kemp do not qualify for free agency until 2011. LaRoche in addition does not qualify until 2012. That is a very BRIGHT future!
amen jungar, A-Rod is leaving his prime years here shortly.
This team would look completely different with a middle of the order slugger. Completely. The only other team in the NL West I could see competing for ARod is SF Giants, and dear lord help us all if they get him. But think about it. AZ’s Chris Young, a rookie, would be leading our team in homers. So would Adrian Gonzalez. We could conceivably have no one on this team hit 20 this year. We need that one guy so badly. Whether its ARod or whoever, we need to go out and get him this offseason. Still, Im don’t think McCourt will pony up for him. I think all the kids will increase their power production next year but I don’t think that going to be enough.
Better to be Grady than A-Rod’s man crush.
I’ll take Arod man crush over no passion grady gump.
I should’ve said after the 2011 season, LaRoche after the 2012 season.
IF we SIGN Arod, Pick-up Wolf and Lieberthal’s Options our budget would still be less than $120mill. I have not accounted for arbitration raises but I think only Yhency and Repko are due for them. Oh and probably Broxton. Im not sure though.
I wouldn’t pick up Wolf and Lieberthal…You never know if Wolf will get hurt again..He’s a liability..and they need a catcher they can trust so we can give Russell some time off..otherwise you’re going to wear him out.
i just added them in there since whomever else we sign would likely be of the same sort of salary. a back-up catcher is about 1.5 or so and a decent SP is about 9.
The only way I would consider A-Rod is if he would have a contract like Ichiro’s, but he won’t, because he has Bora s s has his agent.
Let’s say we play it cool and let someone else overpay for a-rod.
Then let’s just stand pat with our home grown guys and see what happens. WS births are not guaranteed no matter who you sign since players can get hurt or have off years for no reason.
It’s time to add younger utility guys and look for good – not great – pitchers who won’t demand a gazillion dollars liek Schmidt to fill out the rotation until the young stud pitchers in the minors can break through.
I think we need to give the young guys a full season of playing every day together to really know what we’ve got.
californiaautorebuilder, are you serious about your Yankee comments? Not having money to pay for pitching? If you look at the salaries of their pitchers, Clemens, Wang, Pettite, Mussina..you know what, never mind, i thought you had more sense than that.
How many wins do they have combined.
The Yankees are only obligated to a portion of A-Rod’s current contract, we haven’t seen a team take on the $30 mill/year blow since the ’03 Rangers.
Hasn’t Wolf proven to you that he is pretty much done?
He has not thrown 200 innings since 2003.
He has not had an ERA below 4.25 since 2002.
In the last 4 season the leauge is hitting .278 off him.
californiaautobuilder, how many wins they have is not the point. The point is you said, they don’t have money to sign pitchers.
scott, if we dont go after A-Rod we’re looking at another rival possibly being able to get him since the Giants, Angels, and Padres all have loads of money coming off the books and all looking for a power bat. Would you really want to chance NOT making a run at ARod and losing him to the Gnats or Pads? That would be scary.
The had the money to sign old man Clemens and Pettite in the offseason didnt they? They got rid of RJ. Pavano went down. Thats why they have no pitching. And even now they’re not doing badly. Remember both Mussina and Wang were injured this season and Clemens didn’t start pitching until I believe mid June.
like i stated, i included both he and Lieberthal (neither of whom has done anything for us) as a salary slot reference. I figured they had options at set prices and it was easier to include these 2 than make up a salary for someone else and slot them in there.
he’s not going to go to a dumb loser franchise like the Giants or Pads (see Texas Rangers) and Arte said he’s not paying anyone that kind of money.
I meant to say for the amount of wins they have and the amount of money they have spent for the wins, is it really worth it. 
If A-Rod goes to the Giants or Padres, I would be in heaven. We’re looking at Barry Bonds’ single season walk record go down. I don’t think he’d average 2 abs a game in either one of those line-ups.
haha, the Pods going after ARod… now thats comedy.
I agree completely with Scott. Llvproduction I don’t think you should sign ARod just because your scared the pads or giants might get him. Anyway the Giants are a bad team with or without him.
Hendrickson, Beimel, Proctor, Brazoban, and Repko qualify for arbitration after this season.
for once diehard i agree with you. haha.
swood hey little buddy. you called me out last night. Your right I couldn’t complain about grittle leaving Lowe too long. He only threw 85 pitches why did he come out?
swood, im not saying sign him per say im talking about making a run and driving up his price so that the gnats or pads will be seriously hindered if they did. i dont think it’s a bad option either way. im personally fine with a LaRoche/Nomar/Abreu at 3B next yr.
not a very solid bench (Martinez, Olmedo just really not going to cut it.
It really pains me to see the Giants stink…NOT!
The problem with the Dodgers roster is that the one player everyone wants to replace with someone better isn’t going anywhere on account of his high salary and wet noodle of an arm.
Arod will be the final piece not the only piece.
ok lvproduction now I see what you mean. and diehard I swear Grady can’t win with you, either he takes the pitcher out too early or leaves him in too long. I think you should become our new manager and Max should be our bench coach. haha.
If that’s the case what do you do with LaRoche then, why did we hang onto to him then.?
diehardblu, ur on the money there.
who would u want to see LaRoche or Abreu at second…?
you want pitching I am willing to give up LaRoche for some pitching if we have Arod.
LaRoche is a guy with alot of POTENTIAL, and although all of us here seem to agree that he will be a good player, is he really a 40+ HR – 100+ RBI guy? That question won’t be answered until he can be with a team that will give him 500 to 600 ab’s per season. If the Dodgers don’t go after ARod, then the question is , will Colletti and Grady give LaRoche the opportunity? Based on their track record, i say NO.
You guys are getting way to far ahead of yourselves. The chances of us getting ARod realistically aren’t very good. He will probably resign with the yankees. Never underestimate Steinbrenners wallet. We should be focusing on the team we have now.
I still think chariss is a better CF, even with a bad hose.
haha that made me chuckle diehard but unfortionately im a middle infielder.
Arms don’t change hands. It’s self-evident anatomically, and increasingly an axiom throughout baseball, underscored by the Chicago Cubs on Friday with $91.5 million of thick, black ink.
No wonder the first players sought in trade talks are minor league pitching prospects. No wonder teams loathe letting them go.
After it was announced that right-hander Carlos Zambrano had agreed to a five-year contract extension with the Cubs, general managers throughout baseball crossed the top name off the potential free-agent list.
Already, Mark Buerhle and John Smoltz had signed extensions with their current teams.
Who’s left? The aged, infirm and ineffective.
There was a time Curt Schilling, Kenny Rogers, Bartolo Colon, Freddy Garcia and Livan Hernandez would have formed a dynamic free-agent class. That time is long past, yet those could be the top names available this off-season.
Unless you deem Carlos Silva (9-12, 4.30) or Josh Fogg (7-7, 4.64) more desirable. Otherwise it’s pick your poison.
You be the GM. Which of the following could turn around their career and justify, say, a three-year, $24 million deal?
Jason Jennings (2-8, 6.16). Jeff Weaver (4-10, 5.64). Brett Tomko (2-10, 5.67). Kip Wells (6-13, 5.24). Odalis Perez (7-11. 5.78). Kyle Lohse (7-12. 4.56).
Rather than be forced to rifle through that bargain rack, teams are doing all they can to sew up the guys they’ve got, stock up on pitchers in the draft and do their best to develop them.
swood you really want me to start banging on Little. I’m extremly happy with the line up he threw out yesterday so I’m trying to stay positive.
yes diehard I would love for you to tell me what the big problem is with Grady. Maybe im blind but I just don’t see it.
Swood I was a middle infielder in high school and college your suppose to be smarter there. Do you mind me asking what high school you play for?
why did it take grady until we sunk into a big hole to fix the line up?
I play for Robinson High School in Fairfax Station Virginia. I also play for an AAU team called the Mazda Mets. I am hoping to play at a division 2 or 3 college.
You guys are really young aren’t you. I am old, I should just shut up and leave you young guys alone then.
I’m glad to hear that. Here is a tip I didn’t learn until college. If you out work everyone you will out play everyone.
I’m resuming baseball activities with my rec league buddies tomorrow and I’m going to throw one to 3b from CF just to see how much stronger my arm is at 39 than JP and even though I can barely break 80 even when I used to pitch. I can’t believe he is that weak.
diehard, where did you play your college ball, we’re the same age so we may have played against each other.
My son is 12 and he’s been clocked at 58… and there are 3 kids on his traveling team topping 60.. how’s that JP??
“diehardblu”–If you ever call me a Yankee fan again, you’ll find my foot in your backside.
A-Rod may be a fine player–maybe the best player in the game, but in three years with a roster that is the most stacked roster you can get (the worst team money can buy), he has 0 championships, and 0 Pennants. In Junior Griffey’s best year, when they still had Randy Johnson, they did not make it out of the Division Series. And he was never able to lead Texas to the post-season.
Now, I cannot entirely explain his failures in Seattle and New York–but it’s not as if he has not had back-up there, since he has played with at least one other Hall of Famer. You can blame Rivera for blowing back-to-back saves all you want. But leading the ALCS 3-2, why didn’t A-Rod get his team just one more win in two games. It could be bad luck or it could be bad karma, but I don’t really want either part of it.
His tenure in Texas is really what worries me the most. One player cannot win a division, but if one player gets paid $25 Million a year, that means there is not much left for the other 24 (or really, 39) players. A-Rod is likely to seek $30 to $35 Million per year if he opts out (he’s due $27 Million, and the Yankees would probably give him an extension that would get him to $30 Million rather than losing him and the cash considerations that they are still getting from the Rangers). That’s more than 1/4th of what our payroll is likely to be (and a $120 Million to $140 Million payroll is all that you can hope for–even the Dodgers have limits).
The point that it’s a team game is absolutely correct. But the fact that it’s a team game means that it’s insane to value one player at something like 1/4th of the team.
Boys I’m going on 38 in October. What a sweet b-day gift if the dodgers were in the world series. Last time that happened i was going on 18.
leekfink thank you very much, maybe somebody else sees what I see. Still cannot understand how you cannot live on 8 to 10 million a year.
I don’t get it. Nobody expects him to uncork a 100 mph throw from the fence to home, but jeez, just cf to 3b on a hop at least?
california, you and leekfink aren’t the only ones. I started this whole A-Rod debate by saying I don’t want him on the Dodgers.
I figured you were a smart guy, We did go to the same University.
BTW, that’s a .322 BAA (!). Even Tomdrickson keep that in the low .290s, which is bad. The NL BA this season is in the low .260s.
But you can say that for ANYONE who’s been on the roster those same three years. Like Derek Jeter. Or Mike Mussina. Or Hideki Matsui.
old fogey, I would rather have Derek than A-Rod.
xoxrussell, you’re right, no need to get an over the hill 32 year old superstar who can get injured. The young guys on our team will not run the risk of getting injured….why? Oh, because Grady doesn’t play them. I agree, we’re O.K. with the team we have now.
I think Grady really likes Repko, you guys think if Repko was available, Pierre would be playing as much.?
Do I detect a little sarcasm Kiper? I live in a dream world, I guess.
If Repko were available, he to would be part of the Gonzo, Ethier,Young, Kemp platoon. JP would continue to play EVERYDAY in CF.
nice kiper, that was some really nice sarcasm?
alex, what if we could trade Ethier and Delwyn Young to the Pirates for Snell or Gorzelanny then go sign somebody like Hunter or Rowand? You mean to tell me you don’t think that would improve our team?
xoxrussell, not at all man. I just want somebody to come in next year who scares the **** out of the opposition when he steps into the box. You know?
I find that the young ones are exciting. A Rod is a superstar but so is Barry. I still pay to see the young ones. I went to the games when Barry was in Dodger Stadium but not to see him. What a spectacle. It was a circus, not baseball. I like to see good teamwork, not one guy hitting the long ball. I always have said that it’s the small ball that works.
kiper i see what you are saying, but even when we were winning pennants and all that good stuff did we ever have someone like that on the team?
Anyone who signs ARod needs to commit to something like 8 years, $240 million minimum, to ensure that if ARod is in a HR record, they reap the benefits. (8 yrs x 35 HR/year = 280, 280+500 = 780).
charris why do u hate ethier?
why do u want him traded?
Not really, but it depends how far back you want to go. If you’re talking about that great run in the late 70’s early 80’s we had Garvey, Cey, Smith, Monday, Baker all going for 25 to 30 per season. Then in ’88, well that was one in a million a magical season, but if i’m not mistaken Gibson hit 25 HR’s and drove in 99, and he missed 34 games due to injuries. I agree that with great pitching you manufacture runs, small ball, but the Dodgers don’t do that well enough. You need the presence of a guy who can at least hit 20, that’s my point.
Hmmm, A Rod for 8 years and he’ll be 40?? And getting 30 mill??
Let’s Kobe, Farmar and Pierre to the Bulls for Deng, Gordon, Wallace, cash and draft picks.
Let’s not be the ones that pay for A-rods best years by buying history instead of buying the future.
How well did the veteran thing work this year?
Agree with you, but I think that’s what we have here if all goes well.
Maybe what you think.?
I don’t hate Ethier, I just think that JP is untradable and that he has a lower ceiling than Kemp. I also think its imperative to get JP out of centerfield. With the #s Ethier put up this year his trade value will be relatively high. So why not try to trade him for a good young pitcher and go try to get one of those FA outfielders?
Hopefully A Rod would keep hitting well when he’s 40 but maybe he needs some HGH or roids to do that???
As far as i’ve read, ARod has never asked for 8 years. He wants 5 to 7 and i’m sure that after the 5th he’d want an out.
Kiper, you’re right. The Dodgers need to bunt more, hit & run more, go the other way, hit a long fly for a SF like Kemp did last night more often.
why don’t we just get rid of Juan Pierre and then sign Hunter or Jones.
Of course if we resigned Lofton or even went with Repko in center (if he didn’t get hurt obviously) we wouldn’t be having this conversation. Instead we’d be talking about how much money our offer would be to Hunter or Jones.
The 70s Dodgers had the first team with FOUR 30 HR men, back when 30 was a lot. Garvey, Cey, Baker and Reggie Smith were pretty good. Smith’s ’77 and ’78 OPS+ were 167 and 161.
I’m really high on Andre Ethier and think he’s a really special player. He can do it all except steal bases. He has tremendous defense, his arm is good, not a cannon like Kemp. Kemp makes my heart jump every time a ball is hit to him. Ethier is so smooth in the outfield and I he gets great jumps on the ball. I would build the outfield around Ethier and Kemp, whether that includes Pierre, Hunter, Rowand etc…that’s for Ned to decide. You can’t build a team assuming you can sign certain free agents. To answer your question that trade would never happen, if in some way it was offered, I wouldn’t do it. Why pay nine million plus for what we already have in Ethier. If he played everyday he could have some really good solid numbers. He’s also only 25. So no way I trade Ethier. I like Snell and Gorzelanny but they’re not going anywhere and it would take more than that to pry one of them away.
Pierre is untradeable charris but he’s not uncutable.
The 70s Dodgers were awesome.
I would have traded Ethier for Blanton but thats about it.
Man diehard by the way you talked I figured you were in your 40’s or 50’s. Just because you talked about the LaSorda era. By the way where did you play in college?
Ethier has the potential of being a superstar. Trading him would be irrational. But then Betemit was traded when he was hot….
Reggie Smith was a stud!
Pierre is not untradeable. The Dodgers would have to pay a good portion of his salary, but for the right price there would be teams interested. If Colletti really wanted to go after Hunter or Rowand or Jones, Pierre can be moved. It would mean Colletti’s admitting that it was a bad signing, so i doubt it will happen, but make no mistakes, he can be traded.
Just who is this good, young pitcher that other teams are going to trade to the Dodgers for Andre Ethier? Is there anyone out there trading good, young pitchers? The Pirates are going to ask for more than that for, say, Ian Snell.
They should be posting tonights lineup. What do you guys think it will be?? Van?
Gibby hit 25HR and had 76rbi. He missed 12 games.
His OPS+ was 149 (best of his career) OPS+ is essentially OPS normalized to the league and ballpark. Think of it as a rate above the league average (100) expressed as a percentage.
When Piazza was robbed of his MVP award his OPS+ was 186 and his career OPS+ is 144.
The flavor of this blog is different today. What a change two wins make!!! Go Dodgers.
Same lineup as last night is my prediction, if Gonzo is in that lineup I’ll have a conniption fit, for reasons I’ll get into when it’s posted.
OMG THE LINEUP IS UP AND I’M GOING TO PUKE!
Kiper…It’s not really the money on Pierre’s deal that will turn off teams but it’s the number of years. Nobody is going to want a rapidly declining one dimensional player for four more years. Well of course except Ned Colletti.

"Perfect quality and perfect kit. My parameters: height 158 cm, weight 48, about 96, from 64. Bras I wear in the amount of 75C. Here I ordered the top and bottom in the size of L. The village is perfect! Cups in the top took out immediately. Thank you for the goods! I will buy from you more!
I order not the first time and now I can tell a little about this product and store. I really like the store, I 've been looking for something like this for a long time, I wanted to go to sports, comfortable underwear without bones and other things. Now these kits are my new love. Of the nuances: I asked the seller to put top size L, and panties size m. Said he would put it, but in fact everything came in size L. Composition: 88% nylon and 12% spandex, very soft and pleasant to the body material. Of the minuses: it is very easy to put a lead, can slightly diverge on the seam (seen in the photo), after washing is not such a saturated color. The first ordered lavender kit. The top washed already 6-7 times and it slightly faded. From small parts-on different models of panties different gusset, cups get out (I wear without them) My chest is 3 sizes 80c, it sits well. I think if you wear every day and regularly wash them for a long time will not be enough to climb and fade, but for such a price they can safely change every year for new.

"Hello fellow Bella readers. I'm Amy and I blog over at My Little One-Room Schoolhouse. I blog about activities I do with my 6 kids as well as crafts and recipes that I make.
Just like a teacher in the one-room schoolhouses of old would teach a little bit of everything, I include some of this and some of that in my blog. I was happy to give Bella a helping hand and this is actually my first guest post. Today I'm sharing one of my family's favorite Christmas recipes. This is a recipe I grew up making every year and now I make these cookies with my children.
Cream together the butter and shortening. Add powdered sugar. Mix in egg and flavorings. Beat well.
Blend food color into one half.
To make cookies, take one tsp of each color dough.
Roll each into a 4-inch rope by rolling carefully back and forth on lightly floured surface..
Place ropes side by side and press together lightly. Twist.
Place on ungreased cookie sheet and curve top to form the candy cane shape.
Recruit some helpers to make the assembly go quicker since each cookie has to be formed separately.
Bake about 8 minutes at 375 until very light brown and set. Crush peppermint candy. Mix with granulated sugar.
Remove hot cookies from sheet and gently roll or sprinkle with sugar mixture. Place on waxed paper to cool.
Makes about 3 dozen cookies if you can keep the dough-eating monsters away. :) These can be time consuming to make, but the kids have fun making them and they always get ""oohs and aahs"" when served.
**Thanks so much Amy**Those do look incredibly tasty, and the kids look so cute baking with mama. That is always so much fun!! Good luck with the giveaway girl!",http://bellabeforeandafter.blogspot.com/2011/11/my-little-one-room-schoolhouse-takeover.html

"In sports, they say it a lot. A team that may be considered less experienced, unranked, and not great at whatever they should be doing may play like a much better team when they are facing the greats. There's no rationale to it, except our innate sense of competition.
Maybe we're all like that in whatever specialty we do, or whatever type of fun we have. A human desire to stand tall, and fight a good fight to the very end, no matter what it takes, lives on it each of us. I'm not an athletic sort now. I used to play soccer like a wild woman, but those were other years.
When I filled out an application to blog for blackLiquid, one of the comments on the application referenced 'Creativity' as a necessity for the bloggers in that group. I sensed that Ms. B wanted to push people who worked for and with her beyond the norm, always pulling the very best.
I really wasn't sure my blogging, my styling, and my overall aesthetic was good enough to meet the parameters laid out in the application. I shared that I would do my best. After all, that's all any of us can ever do.
So I have reviewed a few items now from blackLiquid. I looked for a different point of view, beyond the normal, outside the box, to show style but also creativity. I'm not there yet, but I know what direction I'm heading. I'm enjoying the journey so very much.
genius!! I love your interpretation!",http://carynashdeneslblog.blogspot.com/2013/10/a-different-point-of-view-featuring.html

"Strategic investment models, though popular in the theoretical literature, have rarely been tested empirically. This paper develops a model of strategic investment in inpatient procedure markets, which are well-suited to empirical tests of this behavior. Potential entrants are easy to identify in such markets, enabling the researcher to accurately estimate the entry threat faced by different incumbents. I derive straightforward empirical tests of entry deterrence from a model of patient demand, procedure quality, and differentiated product competition. Using hospital data on electrophysiological studies, an invasive cardiac procedure, I find evidence of entry-deterring investment. These findings suggest that competitive motivations play a role in treatment decisions.",http://editjems.org/article-item/games-hospitals-play-entry-deterrence-in-hospital-procedure-markets/

"A method was developed for the preparation of chitosan staple fibres containing silver nanoparticles. An aqueous colloidal solution of PVA-encapsulated metallic silver with a particle size of 50-60 nm was admixed to the chitosan-containing spinning solution. From the mixed spinning solution, the fibre was spun by a wet method. The mechanical, electrical, antibacterial, morphological and structural properties of the silver-containing chitosan fibre are highlighted. With a silver content greater than 51 mg/kg, the fibre possessed antibacterial activity. The silver content did not deteriorate the tenacity of the fibre or cause a change in the molecular mass distribution. The impact of spinning conditions on the morphological properties was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). X-ray radiography (WAXS) showed the influence of spinning conditions on the supermolecular structure of the fibre.

"From the initiation of “4+7” pilot areas in 2018 to the national implementation of the fifth centralized drug procurement in 2021, rules of the national centralized procurement, have been gradually improved and normalized, resulting in a major reshuffle of the market competition situation. Have pharmaceutical companies really got their good wish in this “price-for-volume” game over the past two years? For brand-name drugs, whether should they squarely face the fierce competition to get listed, or stick to the price and quit the game? With different choices, what will be the way to get upper hand and what lessons could they learn from?
Illuminera has recently released a blockbuster industry report Future of the Brand-name Drugs after the Surging Tide of VBP (volume-based procurement) and Strategic Enlightenment for Manufacturers (referred to as ""the report"" or ""this report"" for short), to interpret the development course of VBP, influence on multinational pharmaceutical companies, and illuminations for brand-name products in details.
Get stuck or seek for change?
- How brand-name products could break through in “price-for-volume” game?
Most brand-name drug enterprises started to join the VBP game, though reluctant, after looking on the “fight” for a long time, and they are learning to adapt to the new rules, while it is generally predicted that unbid brand-name drugs will go through a cliff-like sales decline. But is this really the case? For drugs that have won the bid, could the good wish of “price-for-volume” be realized as expected?
The report，accomplished by Illuminera’s healthcare consulting team, has deeply probed into VBP influence on brand-name drug enterprises for the first time, through omni-channel and multi-dimensional analysis, from product portfolio, channel sales volume, time span, regional performance, company strategy, and etc. It uncovers the facts and truth behind “price-for-volume”, which is of milestone significance.
In addition to sales data from large hospitals, the report has innovatively incorporated terminal sales data from retail and medical institutions at all levels for in-depth analysis.
Sales volume covered by this report ranges from the pre-implementation stage of VBP (April 2018 to March 2019) to the second implementation of nationwide VBP (April 2020 to September 2020), reflecting the medium to long-term product sales over a 2.5-year time span.
The report not only covers overall changes in national sales volume, but also supports a horizontal analysis of product sales performance in the bid-winning and non-winning regions.
- What should brand-name drug makers pursue for sustainable development?
Through in-depth analysis of a large number of sales data, the report has screened out unbid product portfolios which were both greatly and slightly affected by VBP, identified the key attributors affecting the margin potential of unbid products in each region, and provided strategic inspiration for the sustainable development of unbid products.
Illuminera has been deeply engaged in the medical field for more than ten years, focusing on providing integrated marketing services for customers in the pharmaceutical industry. With the rich experience in prescription drugs, medical devices, over-the-counter drugs (OTC), vaccines, hospitals, digital marketing and other fields, it is a strategic partner of many world-famous pharmaceutical and medical brands.
3.The report reflects only the overall analysis, and uses the combined average data to represent the overall trend. Names of specific products and other related information havn’t been disclosed.

"My 1st brand new Harley. Mom centered me in the picture instead of the bike!
My brand new 1975 Sportster in its original condition. To me, it was ALWAYS a Bronson Bike.
For a while, I rode it to work and everywhere in all seasons so it had to become a full-dresser. Note the Bronson Sissy Bar. My mom upholstered the little pad on the sissy bar and it has been on every bike I owned.
All packed with a tent, sleeping bag and cloths for my first Bronson trip on a Sportster.
The Old Fashioned look.
This was its configuration in 2009 the day I disassembled it for the re-build.
The speedo & tach quit years ago. I never did like those Buckhorn handle bars because they were not like Bronsons.
Some think TCB was from the song Takin' Care of Business, but we all know it spells out Then Came Bronson 1970 was the year I started riding.
The easy part, taking everything off. It must have been the dirtiest Harley around. I was not big on cleaning it, but I regularly sprayed it off at the coin-op carwash that I owned and rode it to everyday.
Here is the Before photo of the engine.
Here are the only tools I needed to disassemble the bike, which only took a little over an hour.
It sure is easy to push around now!
Cleaning and painting the frame. I filed off a lot of weld splatter.
I set up a small air-conditioned shop area for the rebuild. To get all the parts out of the way, I hung them on what has become the Memorial Wall for my original bike. Note the helmet that Evel Knievel signed for me. I wore it on my first Bronson trip in 1974.
Here is the After photo of the engine.
The guy in the White Station Wagon at the start of each episode finally has a good use his car, towing his prized Bronson Bike to motorcycle shows!
Photographed for the book 101 Motorcycles Collection of Vintage Motorcycles at Mountain Fest in Morgantown, West Virginia.
On display in one of the six diorama scenes from the movie set.
On display at Sturgis in 2009 for the week in Michael Lichter's Motorcycle Icon Exhibit.
One of the many photos taken in Lichter's photo booth at Sturgis.
Winning the Best In Show plaque. There were other bikes more deserving of this award, but I think all the judges were fans of the show!
On display at the Antique Motorcycle Club of America show in Davenport, Iowa where it won 2nd in the Period Modified Class.
Parked along the Long Lonesome Highway used in the TV episodes with Wyoming's Teton Mountains in the background.
Racing at a local 1/8 mile drag strip. 80 MPH in 9 Seconds making it the unofficial fastest Bronson Bike. Bronson raced his bike on TV so I had to race mine. Next the Bonneville Salt Flats!
My Tribute Bike. The headlight, switches on the handgrips, fork and the disc brake remind me of my old Harley and are the only items that keep it from being a complete replica of the original Bronson Bike.",http://jimbronson.com/billw/Bill_W_Transformer.htm
"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common sequel of sepsis in the intensive treatment unit. of renal function such as for example metabolic functions from the modulation or kidney from the sepsis cascade. 57 < 0.001). Septic AKI acquired an increased in-hospital mortality price weighed against nonseptic AKI (70.2 51.8%; < 0.001). Median duration of ICU and medical center stay for survivors (37 21d; < 0.0001) was longer for septic AKI.[2] Distinguishing between septic and non-septic AKI therefore might not you need to be of academics interest but may possess clinical relevance for doctors. It's been recommended that septic AKI may possess a definite pathophysiology aswell.[3] Thus septic AKI may possess a unique identity and responses to interventions and outcome may be different with this group of patients when compared to those with non-septic AKI. Significant progress has been made over the years towards learning how to detect AKI early agreeing on an international consensus definition Bay 65-1942 HCl delineating the pathophysiologic mechanisms which predispose to a high incidence of AKI in sepsis seeking to deduce logical protective and preventive strategies and finally on Rabbit Polyclonal to ADCK5. how to deliver the optimal renal support when the kidney fails. This review will try to proffer a bird’s vision view of the recent developments with this field and where we stand right now. Analysis Two classification systems – RIFLE (risk injury failure loss end-stage) criteria[4] and acute kidney injury network (AKIN) criteria[5] have been recently developed and widely validated to diagnose and stratify individuals with AKI. This may enable the development of clinically effective approaches to prevention and management and facilitate comparisons of their effectiveness in different study populations. Early detection Despite significant improvement in therapeutics the mortality and morbidity associated with AKI remain high. A major reason for this Bay 65-1942 HCl is the lack of early markers for AKI akin to troponins in acute myocardial disease and hence an unacceptable delay in initiating therapy. Standard urinary biomarkers such as casts and fractional excretion of sodium have been insensitive and non-specific for the first identification of AKI. Thankfully the use of innovative technology such as useful genomics and proteomics to individual and animal types of AKI provides uncovered several book genes and gene items that are rising as biomarkers. One of the most promising of the certainly are a plasma -panel [neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)[6] and cystatin C[7]] and a urine -panel [NGAL [8] interleukin 18 (IL-18)[9] and kidney damage molecule 1 (KIM-1)[10]]. Because they represent sequentially portrayed biomarkers chances are which the AKI sections will be helpful for timing the original insult and evaluating the length of time of AKI. Predicated on the differential appearance from the biomarkers additionally it is likely which the AKI sections will distinguish between your numerous kinds and etiologies of AKI. Furthermore fresh proof indicates which the biomarkers might be able to differentiate septic from non-septic AKI also. In a report of 83 sufferers (43 with sepsis) in Melbourne septic AKI was connected with considerably higher plasma (293 166 μg/ml) and urine (204 39 μg/mg creatinine) NGAL weighed against non-septic AKI (< 0.001).[11] Pathophysiology The precise pathophysiology of Bay 65-1942 HCl sepsis-induced AKI isn't known nonetheless it is normally accepted it includes a multi-pronged damage pathway. This type of AKI provides the different parts of: ischemia-reperfusion damage direct inflammatory damage coagulation and endothelial cell dysfunction and apoptosis.[12] Bay 65-1942 HCl Moreover predicated on latest evidence we might presume which the pathophysiologic mechanisms of sepsis-induced AKI will vary from non-septic AKI.[13] This might translate towards the presssing concern that sepsis-induced AKI may entail different therapeutic strategies. Gram-negative sepsis which is normally more prevalent in India is normally connected with AKI independently.[14] An increased plasma focus of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) is normally often within the systemic flow during sepsis whatever the kind of the infecting microorganism [15] perhaps due to the translocation of LPS from the citizen Gram-negative flora from the gut.[16] Through the inexorable unpredictable manner of sepsis LPS.

"Defending champion Rafael Nadal blasted French Open schedulers as a “joke” on Friday as long-time rival Roger Federer remained on Roland Garros easy street.
Spanish third seed Nadal, chasing an unprecedented eighth Paris title, saw off Slovakia’s Martin Klizan 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 to record his 54th win in 55 matches at the tournament.
For the second round in succession, the 26-year-old dropped the first set as he struggled in the cold, heavy conditions where the temperature just nudged over the 12-degree mark.
He then launched a blistering attack on tournament chiefs who he described as a “joke” and claimed he was being treated unfairly.
Nadal’s match had been held over from Thursday after torrential rain swamped Paris.
He had been placed third on the Court Suzanne Lenglan schedule, following one men’s match and a women’s singles.
His third round opponent, Fabio Fognini, meanwhile, had been scheduled second on Court Three to follow just one women’s singles match which took only an hour to complete.
“The schedule was wrong, it was a bad decision,” said Nadal.
With third seed Nadal having to play his third round match on Saturday, second seed Federer had already ensured his place in the last 16.
His 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 win over France’s 30th seed Julien Benneteau, who was restricted by a leg injury, marked his best start to the tournament.
Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer, who made the semi-finals in 2012, continued his low-key run.
Ferrer beat compatriot Feliciano Lopez, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4 to set-up a fourth round clash against either Canadian 14th seed Milos Raonic or 23rd seed Kevin Anderson of South Africa.
Croatia’s 10th seed Marin Cilic was the biggest name to fall, losing 7-6 (14/12), 6-4, 7-5 to Serbia’s Viktor Troicki.
In the women’s competition, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova stayed firmly on course for a showdown in the final by swatting aside overmatched opponents.
Defending champion and second seed Sharapova was first up, needing only four games and a handful of minutes to finish off her second round tie 6-2, 6-4 against Canadian teenager Eugenie Bouchard.

I installed the whole thing in one day and the only pain was routing the main halyard and the boom furling line into the cockpit ( with least friction possible ) and I had to modify the new Shaefer blocks to suit.
